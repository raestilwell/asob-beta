		<h1>Chapter IV.</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>&#8220;Oh! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>The fluttering, feminine wail of distress was accompanied by the sight of a woman who appeared to be dancing the waltz at sunset near the closed formal entrance of the sprawling expanse of Anowen Castle. Her partner was the precarious pile of books that she was trying to balance, despite the top of the stack being four books higher than the top of her jet-black crown. She had been doing quite well until her pull on the bell of the main door had not resulted in the door opening as quickly as she would have liked. Raven&#8217;s experiment with fishing for a key in her skirts with one hand had gone horribly awry. The key was on the ground several feet away, and she was left desperately trying to prevent the spill of the fragile (and very old) collectors&#8217; editions of her day&#8217;s purchases for the library.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Raven, my sweet, if you were so desperately in need of a partner to fill your card, you had but to ask. I know Lian is far less available than any should like, but I daresay I&#8217;m beyond crushed if I&#8217;m not to be counted upon for even scrappy seconds.&#8221; The voice carried the familiar inflection of courtly despair that often had Raven inclined to waste a perfectly good book in use as a missile targeted at its owner&#8217;s handsome head. For as much as she loved the Castilian like an older brother, Raven had less patience to endure his façade of courtship than most others in the castle.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;If I lose ONE book while you stand there preening, Dori, I swear,&#8221; Raven&#8217;s warning was muffled behind her mountain. The touch of the Lord&#8217;s hand atop the tower stabilized it. Then her tower grew lower and lower, book by book until Raven&#8217;s powder-blue gaze was revealed to a pair of amused coffee-brown eyes under a mess of windblown, black locks. Dorian shoved his small stack of books irreverently under one armpit and reached for his own key.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know that there&#8217;s room for one more book in your monstrosity of a collection Raven,&#8221; he offered the insult to Raven&#8217;s treasure almost cheerfully. &#8220;I think I shall be obliged to relieve you of a few. I&#8217;m sure Lian won&#8217;t mind. There was a book of poems one layer above your pretty forehead. That will do nicely.&#8221; He slipped the key into the lock and it turned easily in the well-oiled mechanism, and then he was flourishing a bow at the open door, to welcome his company home.</p>
		
		<p>Raven squinted a look at the Castilian but did not move forward. &#8220;Poetry, mhmm?&#8221; She pointed a finger somewhere near the top button of his sateen vest and poked, once, firmly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t think I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re up to, Dorian Vaughn. If ONE page of that collection gets so much as a scribble on it&#8230;&#8221; Her glare had all the ferocity of a big cat. After that, she huffed and crossed the threshold. &#8220;And don&#8217;t be scampering off just yet. It&#8217;s bad enough we have to share Lian&#8230;&#8221; Her implication that she was not averse to enjoying a moment more of his company did not have to be spoken. &#8220;You look well.&#8221; As he usually did. She took a step forward into the doorframe. &#8220;Are you staying at Anowen a while?&#8221; She paused and looked over her shoulder. &#8220;Goodness, I forgot my key.&#8221; It was still out there on the paved entryway.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s only stayin&#8217; if it&#8217;s a holiday,&#8221; the answer came from within the main hall before Eden came sweeping past Dorian in nothing but her corselet and shift. Eden was, by all accounts, a young woman, hardly grown beyond puberty so that she still maintained a child&#8217;s almost bird-like frame. She had quite recently chopped her corn silk colored hair so that it fell in wisps of curls around her ears and the middle of her neck. A dancing step took her around Raven, though she spared a moment to narrow her ruby-red eyes at the stack of books she held. &#8220;We hardly needed more books,&#8221; she said. Her eyes lifted to Dorian.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Or more of you,&#8221; came her cheerful addition Dorian&#8217;s way. She bowed down to collect the key, squinting in the sunlight. &#8220;The king must have had another baby to christen. Or the pope died. Or we&#8217;ve won the war. It&#8217;s been long enough since your last visit, hasn&#8217;t it? Is it a bank holiday?&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Eden&#8230;&#8221; Dorian flourished one of his deepest bows in the direction of the girl turned woman. For all of Eden&#8217;s three hundred and twenty-two years of immortal life, and her ranking seniority over several of the brides in the coven, she had never seemed quite able to mature much past her mortal sixteen years old or to particularly care for making the effort to pretend that she had. Dorian was as fond of the former street urchin as Lian was, forever grateful for the sacrificial act that had cost the girl her mortal life in trying, needlessly to save Lian&#8217;s own. Their bond had never been a bridal one. If Lian had ever thought to have a sister, Eden was as close to that as he would experience in eternity. Her place within the coven was unique, for any number of reasons, but that did not stop Dorian from teasing her mercilessly with the same flamboyant game of courtship that he played for everyone&#8217;s entertainment. Save one.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Eden. Garden of my heart. There are rules in the 19th century. I do not think it is <em>gentille&#8230;&#8221;</em> He spoke the word in French, &#8220;to appear outdoors in one&#8217;s undergarments — as fetching as sight as you present.&#8221; His gaze dropped to her bare feet. &#8220;And shoes&#8230; shoes, beloved. They are a thing.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Eden rolled her eyes skyward. &#8220;Listen to that draff.&#8221; She plucked the edges of her shift up to dip into a quick mock curtsy. &#8220;There are rules in every century, and the necklines plunge lower and the bustles get a little thicker. And I just keep gettin&#8217; younger and younger.&#8221; The last had grown truer, it seemed. Women married later outside of the aristocracy, and it had not escaped her notice in town that she was one to be treated like a child. It suited her fine.</p>
		
		<p>Eden lifted a bare foot so that she could sweep away a small garden spider that had deemed to crawl across it. &#8220;It would be a safe night, anyway. It&#8217;s Sophie&#8217;s lot&#8217;s turn to hunt. It&#8217;ll be quiet enough that you could probably stay.&#8221; Dropping her foot, Eden chased after Raven&#8217;s side and looped an arm beneath the stack of books to replace the key in the woman&#8217;s pocket. Raven flashed her a grateful smile.</p>
		
		<p>Dorian paused, considering her words. &#8220;You tempt me. It is not often that I am spared an assault by the felines on a visit.&#8221; He stood for a moment, looking lost with the books in his hand. &#8220;Where am I putting these?&#8221; That was for Raven.</p>
		
		<p>The younger among them huffed, dropping her hands on her hips. "Well, not a holiday, then. Here I was expecting gifts."</p>
		
		<p>Raven bustled ahead, leaving little choice but for Eden and Dorian to follow. &#8220;You have always expected too much of Dorian dearest,&#8221; was her cheerful rejoinder Eden&#8217;s way. &#8220;Where else shall we put them, but the place that you have determined can hold no more,&#8221; she offered sweetly to the dark-haired Lord. &#8220;I think you underestimate the sheer majesty of what we are building here, Dorian.&#8221; Her happy sigh was ecstatic as she pushed through the doors of the library. It was a grand collection, two stories tall with as many books to fill both walls.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;There will ALWAYS be room for one more,&#8221; Raven waved her free hand over to one of the larger writing station desks. &#8220;Rest them down over there, and make a note of the title of the poetry you are taking. I&#8217;m expecting it to be returned. Do not think that I have failed to notice the mysterious disappearance of several copies from my collection. Do pass that message along, dear.&#8221; Her dark brow winged upward in sharp reproof. &#8220;We can retire to the sitting room for a cozy visit. You can join us, Eden, if you&#8217;d like.&#8221; Raven seemed less concerned with Eden&#8217;s choice of attire than Dorian was.</p>
		
		<p>Hidden in a nook of the library so as not to be immediately seen, another queen pushed herself up from the red velvet cushion. Ayla was a trail of pin-straight black hair that fell around her thighs and a black dress with a spencer jacket that looked like a widow&#8217;s attire. She snapped her book neatly closed in one hand, and it was a look and gentle bow of her head that served as her deference to the elder among the trio who had invaded her solitude. However, Eden was the one who elicited a worn look.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Eden, you could wear clothes and be no less the tomboy.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Ayla, you could wear color and be no less dreary.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Ayla lifted her hand as if to stifle the conversation before it continued further. "Enough. I walked into it." Her palm dropped to the cover of her book. She drifted quietly around the furniture, to the iron, spiral staircase that led to the upper library floor.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you supposed to be getting ready to babysit?&#8221; Eden called after her.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;My sanity demands I spend as little time around the kittens as is possible.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;That would be why I choose not to be responsible.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Responsibility is overrated,&#8221; Dorian chimed in dryly as he finished the flourishing notation that had been demanded by their resident librarian. He straightened, then acknowledged Ayla&#8217;s presence with a bow, and a quiet, &#8220;M&#8217;Lady&#8230;&#8221; before being distracted by the treasure in hand.</p>
		
<p>His fingers briefly skimmed over the cover of the book of centuries-old poems. Joanna would appreciate it, he thought to himself. He&#8217;d have to remember to pass on Raven&#8217;s request that she not indulge in her habit of destroying books by writing in the margins as she was wont to do. Dorian had seen and been to Joanna&#8217;s literary hideaway in the servants&#8217; quarters several times, and so he was only too aware of where Raven&#8217;s missing works had found a new, temporary home. That Raven had not descended like a banshee to reclaim them, spoke volumes of the relationship between the women. It was one that he was glad for.</p>

<p>It had not taken long to discern that several of the older, more intolerant and selfish brides had decided upon Joanna for the role of whipping girl in their miserable eternity. She was the plainest among the queens, and without Lian&#8217;s sun to warm their season, they were pleased to let her know it. It had been that fact that had caused him to single Joanna out for extra kindness, at first. Now it was his own selfish desire for her company and the strange filling of a void that she provided for him, that was a cause for most of his irregular visits to the castle. There were some among the brides that he suspected knew of his weakness for one of the youngest of their number. He was careful, all too careful, not to make it an established fact; especially with the hellcats among their brood. He could not be here to protect Joanna from the worst of their scratches, and her torment would only grow worse if they had double the cause to be jealous and competitive. Just thinking about the poet, made him restless to be done with the niceties of the parlor games he paid as a price to gain access to his true prize of the evening. He tucked the book under his arm and turned again to the ladies present.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ayla, a pleasure as always to see you, my dear; though I cannot envy you your evening.&#8221; That Ayla had been given the responsibility to make sure that some of Lian&#8217;s more careless brides did not draw undue attention on their hunt was evident. Knowing the women in question, she would no doubt have her hands full.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would envy the castle less were I to ignore the duty,&#8221; Ayla offered, dryly. Having replaced her book, the woman drifted quietly down the stairs to exit the library without another word.</p>

<p>Dorian&#8217;s attention shifted to the remaining two. &#8220;As much as I wish I could indulge myself with the delights of your companionship, my dears. I fear I must be about my business for the eve. If I decide upon staying, I shall pop by your lair to say goodnight, Raven,&#8221; since it was she who had most directly sought his company. &#8220;I shall see your messages delivered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dori,&#8221; Eden frowned, pressing her hands against his back for a light shove. &#8220;Visit more. Or let me come visit you. I&#8217;ll be your cousin for all the pretty things you bring home.&#8221; For her own fairness, she could hardly pass as that much to the Castilian. Then the girl grinned and lifted her hands before sweeping them to the door to let him pass.</p>
