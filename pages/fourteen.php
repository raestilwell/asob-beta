		<h1>Chapter XIV.</h1>
		<hr>
		
		<p>The Redmond manor was once again as silent as a tomb in the darkness. The momentary disruption caused by the stir of its retainers to the sound of slamming doors, had been settled quickly with a pale-faced explanation from Delilah that claimed a misadventure while bringing warm milk back to her room after a bout of insomnia. That Alice had fixed her with a skeptical, penetrating stare for long moments, had only added to Delilah&#8217;s growing distress during the encounter. The awkward silence had lingered on until Delilah held up an empty mug with fingers wrapped around it as if for warmth, with another breathed apology.</p>
		
		<p>It had been all that she could do to keep herself together until she had quietly closed her door to their backs on their departure, and then turned her own to the door to slide helplessly down its support into pool of bare limbs and white cotton to weep in a self-enforced silence with choked sobs that rocked her body. Why had he done it to her? Had it been as his wife had said that they looked so similar? She remembered the intensity of his looks, now; the examinations so powerful that she could feel his touch in them and she wondered. Was it his wife he was seeing in her face? How she would slap his own, now, if he were before her. How she would pound upon his chest, and scream her anguish for his betrayal. He had given her hope, and now he had taken it away.</p>
		
		<p>Lian, Lian&#8230; Lian. Her soul keened it in silence as her body rocked, until, eventually, she was still, exhausted from the controlled storm of emotions. Her hair was bedraggled, her face tear streaked, and her eyes no doubt puffy and red. She could feel the soreness of her lower lip where she had bitten down on it hard enough to bruise. She looked, she could imagine, as so many countless society mistresses looked upon encountering the reality of their place and circumstance, after daring to dream. The sad irony, was that she had never even tasted of his love. His seductive power had never been applied to even that much effort. That she was disappointed that it had not, was of all things the most telling, and she realized just how far she had fallen into his snare.</p>
		
		<p>Lady Redmond was right. Neither of them mattered to Lian, but Delilah had a chance to escape while she still had some remnants of her name and virtue left, no matter how much she might fantasize about laying it at his feet. She passed the heel of her hands over her cheekbones. What time was it? She could not face him on the morrow, and his wife had said he&#8217;d be home with the dawn. She had to leave, to get away from this sordid tapestry of lies and betrayal while she still could.</p>
		
		<p>It was as if having made that decision, Delilah found the strength of will to move again. She pushed up onto her feet and looked around the room that had become home to her, at all her little touches. Even that, had been taken from her. All she could see now, was the overlay of another room, shared by sisters. No, it was best that she leave, though she sincerely regretted that she would not be able to give the requisite two weeks&#8217; notice. She wasn&#8217;t going to ask Lian for a reference anyway, which meant, of all ironies, that she was precisely in the position in which she had started, before Lian had saved her reputation and livelihood by hiring her. Would that he had left her to her fate, rather than used her for a pawn in his game of hearts.</p>
		
		<p>The next hour passed by in silence, save for the quiet opening and closing of her closet and chest of drawers as Delilah quietly packed the two bags that she had brought with her. The only garment that had not been packed, was a periwinkle blue riding jacket and its paired black skirt. There were a few rust colored spots on the right collar and shoulder, but apart from that, it had been cleaned and pressed. Delilah laid it out upon the bed. She would not have it said that she had taken anything with her when she left that was not truly her own. </p>
		
		<p>That her bags were almost too large to carry on her own only came to realization when she was done. She would have to leave on foot in the middle of the night, and she had no way of knowing where she was going. She couldn&#8217;t take her bags. She would have to leave them behind and send a note requesting delivery when she was settled. That Lian would have to know where she had settled was a thought that troubled her, but perhaps if she stayed a few days at a temporary location, she could travel on from there in privacy. Or perhaps she could leave the bags with someone and trust that they would keep her confidence. She dismissed the thought almost as soon as it came. None of Lian&#8217;s staff would betray his trust, even if he had betrayed hers, although she was tempted to confide in Alice. There had been something about the woman&#8217;s behavior which had betrayed that the retainer knew that something was amiss.</p>
		
		<p>With a softly exhaled sigh, Delilah sat down at her vanity and stared at the stack of parchment leaves, the quill pen and the ink pot that had been laid out. The more time she wasted thinking about how to leave, the harder it would be to do it. Everything else could be addressed later. Now, she needed to leave, and to make sure that Lian Redmond should have the least inclination possible to follow her. Not that he would, now that his fun was over, as his wife so ably had ensured.</p>

		<p>She reached for the quill, dipped it in ink and began.</p>

		<p><em><s>Dear Lian,</s></em></p>
		
		<p>She paused, drew a neat line through the greeting and began again underneath.</p>
		
		<p><em>My Lord Redmond,</em></p>
		
		<p><em>By the time you have finished reading this letter, it is quite likely that I shall no longer be officially in your employ. I cannot say that I shall blame you for making the decision; there are certain protocols that should reasonably be expected of a servant, and I regret that I am unable to provide a fortnight&#8217;s notice.</em></p>
		
		<p><em>There are also, I would suppose it fair to say, certain protocols that might be expected between friends, and if we have been nothing else, my Lord, I thought we had been that.</em></p>
		
		<p><em>We have never been anything but <s>honest</s>, direct with each other, and so I know you would expect nothing less from me now.</em></p>
		 
		<p>That sentence was promptly smudged by the splash of a tear that dropped onto the parchment and soaked in. Delilah stared at the spreading blot, considered beginning again and then for the sake of time, carried on.</p>

	<p><em>There is no easy way but for to say it. I met your wife tonight. If you are surprised for the fact, you can imagine my own. I am sorry to say that through fault of my own, she has become convinced that we are having a clandestine relationship, and the resultant exchange is not one which I should care to live through again.</em></p>
	
	<p><em>She was pleased to point out to me, however, the evidence that I cannot dispute, which serves to suggest that our current understanding is not a unique one. That I am almost a mirror image for your wife, who was once also a servant in your employ, and indeed was once the occupant of the room I have been pleased to use, are coincidences that no woman of sound mind and character can ignore.</em></p>
	
	<p><em>I am happy for you, that you have once upon a time found love with one in your service, enough to court and <s>bed</s> wed. But you can understand, I am sure, that I am more than aware that such an outcome is not to be hoped for or dreamed of for myself, if ever that was your honorable intention. I cannot stay under your roof and in your employ, my Lord, knowing that I am but a replacement for another, and one of lesser value and of a cause for a lesser hope than she. </em></p>
	
	<p>As if the effort to sustain that more socially appropriate tone had exhausted all of her willpower, the letter would turn suddenly more personal.</p>
	
	<p><em>I have cried more tears this night Lian, than I thought it possible for my eyes to hold. I hold only myself to blame, for hoisting upon you a hope which you were never obligated to fulfill. I am at one and the same time furious and desolate, and I cannot help but be happy that you are not here, for it would not be a pillow that would be thrown at your face this time. I think I am within my rights to declare myself abused by your choices. That you would make a game of my heart, has wounded more deeply than I can find the words to share.</em></p>
	
	<p><em>I find that I cannot take my bags with me at this moment. I would be grateful if you would see to their safe storage until I send word of where they might be delivered, if I can ask one more favor of you for the use of a transport.</em></p>
	
	<p><em>Until then, be well my Lord, I bear you no ill will.</em></p>
	
	<p><em>Ms. Delilah Flowers</em></p>
