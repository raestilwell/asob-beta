		<h1>A Song of Blood:</h1>
		<h2 style="margin-top: -10px;">Book One</h2>
		<p><em>&#8220;I am, and have only ever been, a monster.&#8221;</em></p>
		<p><em>There was only one future he could give her, one withering curse that he could inflict, and no guarantee that her song would keep him alive for her eternity.</em></p>
		<p>Seasons came and seasons went, but for Lord Lian Redmond, the curse of immortality had become a gilded prison of which he was both the chief inmate and warden. None of the stolen beauties with which he had planted his castle garden had held the key â€” the song in their blood that could keep the withering of his soul entirely at bay. Each bloom had faded, wilted by the shadows of silence and darkness that prowled the recesses of his heart and mind; all of his chosen brides doomed to the curse of an eternity without his love. Now, after one hundred years of apathy, a new Flower and her unique song has literally fallen at his feet. Dare he chance stealing one more rose for his garden in the hope that she would be his eternal song? Or would his choice condemn another innocent to his prison, for the sake of one more season in the sun.</p>
		<p><em>&#8220;You are not a monster, Lian, only a man.&#8221;</em></p>
		<p>The honorable Miss Delilah Flowers was all too aware of the fate that awaited a young, unmarried governess of no means, who had just been dismissed without references. So when circumstances landed her in the employ of the enigmatic and detached Lord Redmond, she was only too grateful for the opportunity to salvage what chance remained for a reputable future in service. That the Lord of the manor appeared to have a growing interest in her beyond what was seemly for a servant, was at once worrisome, and the beginnings of a fantastic hope that her dreams of love and marriage might finally come true. It might be too much to believe that a Lord might wed a maid, but would she have the fortitude to resist him if his interest in her proved to be less than honorable?</p>
