		<h1>Chapter IX.</h1>
		<hr>

		<p>A cold front that rolled off the Humber weeks before had settled into the chill of autumn. Easthaven&#8217;s colors had shifted from rich greens to earthy reds, yellows, and browns. By October, many of the trees and the town&#8217;s garden were bare. It had been the cold that marked a change in the entertainments sought by the elite. The summer drives and outings and the lovely garden parties had been replaced with indoor dinners, games, and dances. Lian Redmond had little interest in partaking in social events of any manner, let alone those that required dancing. Of course, his lack of interest in anything at all had been a given in those withering years. That he expressed a preference in remaining at home, or any preference at all for that matter, was newer in the last few months.</p>
		 
		<p>He still did not deny Dorian those invitations into the public eye. He remained disposed to curtness and seemed ever an odd match for the flamboyant charm of the Castilian, but Lian tried to be social. He could even make a fair go at it when the mood seemed to strike. That mood came a little more often, now, accompanied by layers of mellow violin and gently plinking piano keys in his blood. At tonight&#8217;s dinner party, he had even smiled, up until the moment Mrs. Prichett seemed to take it as a signal of his eligibility. Her daughter, of course, was much in need of a husband. Lian had little qualms about laying that notion to rest quickly, although Mrs. Prichett&#8217;s determination had led him to eventually encourage her Dorian&#8217;s way.</p>
		
		<p>If Lian had been amused by that, he did not dare smile again while they were at the party.</p>
		
		<p>Long after the affair had ended Lian and Dorian were still in town. It was one thing to eat socially, but it offered little by ways of true sustenance. That need was filled in the darkness of mostly empty streets, although Lian remained no less picky for his meals.</p>
		
		<p>The blonde was silent as their carriage carried them into the depths of Easthaven, his eyes closed so that if it were not for the rigidness of his posture he might have seemed to be sleeping. He was thinking or listening for those whispers of thoughts through the night that would belie where a suitable target might be found. His black tailcoat was open, revealing the navy silk vest and the matching puff tie that had been loosened at his throat. It was the gently swaying cello melody playing through his soul that betrayed him, more than the composure of his expression, that the better spirits had remained with him â€” matchmaking aside.</p>
		
		<p>Dorian was, as was his wont, a warmer heat to Lian&#8217;s coolness in the shadows of the swaying carriage. His own raven dark suit was contrasted by the blood warm tones of a maroon vest and a complementary silk tie the color of claret. One leg was crossed over the other, the shine of his evening shoes beating an idle time to a rhythm inaudible to their driver above. It only served to add to his own lazy contentment of an evening spent in relatively enjoyable company, save for the pressing attention of one Miss Prichett. His thumb grazed the engraving on the surface of his gold-plated pocket watch idly, mainly for the tactile stimulation; although he kept a watchful eye on the hour. He found from experience that the prime hunting time tended to be just after the drinking houses closed. Men too intoxicated to be troublesome, and prostitutes on the lookout for such seemingly easy targets were both themselves fodder for the predators that most could not dream even existed.</p>
		
		<p>They were rapidly approaching the hour, and Dorian could feel the increasing burn of the tightness in his veins for the anticipation of the night&#8217;s hunting to come. One more circle around the square and it would be time to disembark to begin their evening&#8217;s walk.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;If that little ditty is on account of your satisfaction in having cast a blight on my evening, old man. I stand ready to remind you that eternity is a long time in which to serve up a cold meal.&#8221; Of Revenge, as Lian no doubt anticipated. They had been at this game for far too long for him to accept anything but that Lord Vaughn would find a way to return the fire. &#8220;Though I must admit it is much preferred to the death march you were caterwauling when last we had occasion for such a ride.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Miss Prichett seemed nice,&#8221; Lian offered without opening his eyes.</p>
		
		<p>Dorian glanced in the elder&#8217;s direction. &#8220;It would seem your&#8230; extended vacation from the duties of Lord of the Castle is paying dividends. Though you will no doubt pay dearly for it when you poke your head up above ground again.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>The blonde made a quiet sound like a huff of breath. If it was meant to be an agreement of the fact, he did not answer it beyond a flicker of a sidelong glance the Castilian&#8217;s way before glancing out the window.</p>
		
		<p>Dorian had returned to the castle on three different occasions in as many months since his last visit. That had been the end of July, and now November was looming around the bend. Lian had not been to his brides in that entire time, as Dorian had been given to hear with increasing volume on each occasion that he had made an appearance. It was only because he had been personally aware of the depth of Lian&#8217;s apathy, that he had not acceded to the repeated requests of the brides to investigate and determine the cause for his absence and the time of his planned return. For all his own patience and understanding, however, even Dorian was beginning to evidence a mild curiosity regarding the change of seasons that his sire seemed to be experiencing.</p>
		
		<p>If he did not know better, Dorian would have been inclined to chalk up the differences in the song in his blood, to the warming awareness of a woman in Lian&#8217;s life. It would be far from the first time that Dorian had lived through the emergent changes that engaging a new song could illicit for his sire. But as far as he knew, Lian had been holed up on his estate. There had been no travels, and only engagements in his own company or on business to account for. It couldn&#8217;t be a woman. He chose tonight, to honor his not quite spoken promise to the elder&#8217;s responsibilities.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Your wives are of a mind to know when next they might be expected to be graced with your presence.&#8221; He leaned back in the seat and closed his eyes. &#8220;And, I might add. They were quite insistent upon there being an answer.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;I do not have one,&#8221; Lian replied, matter-of-factly. &#8220;Although I am appreciative of your visitations to the castle. I am sure having someone to howl at may make them less likely to mob me when I return.&#8221; He was due to visit, although the awareness of what awaited him had him further inclined to put it off. The longer he waited, of course, the worse it would be.</p>
		
		<p>The carriage rumbled to a stop and Lian was the first to emerge to begin straightening his clothes and tightening his tie back into place. He made it no further than that first step out of Dorian&#8217;s way before he lifted a gloved hand. &#8220;Wait&#8230;&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Dorian descended from the carriage with a light hop, a glance of idle curiosity directed Lian&#8217;s way for that command. Had he found a target already?</p>
		
		<p>It was no target, but a queen. Joanna was the flash of golden curls on the street across from their corner. In her jade pelisse, she seemed much more the lady walking alone. It had evidentially fooled at least one other in the darkness, some young man with a slight stumble to his step that was following at a careful pace behind her. The hitch in her pace would have been telling of the moment that she became aware of the elders. She almost ruined her own ploy by lifting her head to look their way when she had stopped. The gentry shadow tailing her likewise stopped, shifting back into the darkness beyond the streetlamp, and she managed to keep her face down.</p>
		
		<p>That it was Joanna they had encountered triggered an immediate and visceral reaction in Dorian&#8217;s gut, spiking his song into a distorted ripple of a scale that betrayed both affectionate recognition and a heavier undertone of worry. The viciousness with which he clamped down on his conscious emotions and all but willed his mind to blankness was telling in and of itself, even in Lian&#8217;s distraction.</p>
		
		<p>Joanna remained still as if the intrusion had caused her to lose track of her thoughts entirely. Finally, she turned a glance behind her and picked up a quicker pace that turned into a run a few steps later, once her shadow had made it clear that he was still intent on following. He chased her right into the cover of an alley.</p>
		
		<p>Lian watched the darkness up until the moment the resounding footsteps and shuffling ceased, only lifting a hand to pinch the space between his brows. It was unfortunate to cross paths with his brides&#8217; hunting party. He would have to come up with an answer sooner, rather than later, for his absence. Yet, he found it difficult to think for the song that had played so loudly from the blood of the man at his side.</p>
		 
		<p>Dorian spoke quickly, in an all too casual attempt to explain away what he knew would be an evident reaction. Fortunately, he meant every word he said. &#8220;I must admit that I will never quite get used to the idea of the women hunting. Call me barbaric, or over-indulgent, I shall never be able to see them as anything but the fairer and weaker sex.&#8221; Even though he had seen enough of a vampiress in a fury to know that they were more than capable of protecting themselves. &#8220;Especially the children.&#8221; Easier to think of Joanna as the fledgling she was. For all that she was a queen, everything about the French woman screamed of her relative youth and immaturity to her sisters; it raised the fiercest instincts to defend and protect her. &#8220;I should hope that there is another of our family attending to her assistance in the alley.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Dorian, a man cannot be blamed for what he hears being shouted,&#8221; Lian offered, almost too quietly and shifted his attention to his cuffs. &#8220;Nor would he blame another for securing that which he is concerned for.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Dorian shifted his attention to Lian&#8217;s profile for that comment, a wary cautiousness replacing the furrow on his brow. What Lian may have meant was a subject that he didn&#8217;t particularly care to broach right there and then, but he knew now, that it would be a conversation to be faced, someday. He did not hold out much hope for the exchange to be anything but a death knell for the nature of their bond and trust as it had stood for centuries. He was in love with his sire&#8217;s bride, and soon enough, there would be no hiding the fact.</p>
		
		<p>Something about what he could see over Lian&#8217;s shoulder caused the man to lose some of his tension, and despite the context of the moment he managed to relax enough to twitch a smile. He offered an amused observation, &#8220;It seems I shall not have to wait a lifetime to see you your Miss Prichett and raise you one wildcat, old friend.&#8221; If they were so lucky as to engage only one of his sisters.</p>
		
		<p>As if summoned by mention, a purr of delight sounded an approach along the sidewalk behind them. &#8220;Lian&#8230; darling&#8230;&#8221; That last word was drawn out in the familiar honeyed tones of one of Society&#8217;s perennial darlings in her own right. At the not quite tender age of three hundred and ninety-two, the Lady Sophie Morewin and the fifth bride of the delinquent Lord Redmond, was every bit as ravishing as she had been when she had first caught his eye as a glittering jewel in the crown of the privileged circle of Henry V&#8217;s court in the summer of 1418. She was a tall woman in a society that now preferred its women petite, but Sophie had only used the trend to emphasize her own uniqueness in that muted garden. Lustrous, strawberry-blonde curls were piled atop her crown, exposing her ears and a throat that dripped with sapphires and diamonds â€” her choice for the accent on the peacock blue and white satin gown that only just avoided being scandalous by society&#8217;s standards. Her status was by and large protected by her manufactured identity as a widowed heiress, and she was more than happy to be the focus of whispers and looks for her overt flamboyance.</p>
		
		<p>The tall arc of a feather bobbing in the hat nested into her curls only added to her height and threatened to poke Lian in the eye as she leaned in to claim a kiss of greeting on each cheek. &#8220;I do declare that were it not for your song we would have deemed you quite deceased,&#8221; she said with a pout of red-stained lips. &#8220;It is unkind of you to leave us to the mercies of the unmentionables for months, and months, and months! Whatever can have stolen you from our comforts? I declare myself quite ready to run whatever it is into the ground. Do say that we shall see you soon. We miss you so.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Lian retreated to that safer, more gentlemanly space. One hand swung behind his back and the other reached for Sophie&#8217;s for a brush of a kiss upon her knuckles. &#8220;My lady,&#8221; was his polite greeting against her skin. &#8220;I have been unkind. I do hope you can accept my apologies. I surely deserve the tempest that awaits.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>For all that Sophie was tittering and strutting like the peacock that her fashion emulated, her blue-grey eyes were searching his with a keen astuteness, a hawkish attention to detail that let nothing escape her notice. In an instant, she was taking in his expression and mood, and attuning herself to his song for the clarity that could only be experienced now, with a closer proximity. When she spoke again, however, her words were directed at the dark-haired elder nearby.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Dorian, dear. You are beyond unkind to be keeping him all to yourself when you know how desperate we are for his attentions,&#8221; she complained.</p>
		 
		<p>She shifted subtly so that she could see around the men and into the open carriage. &#8220;You&#8217;re all alone? How dreary for you. Fortunate that we happened to run into each other then. Kristiana and I will be happy to keep your company. We have already dined, and Joanna and Ayla are smart enough between their two heads to find their way home.&#8221; Her feather twisted, nearly slapping Dorian across the face for the turn. &#8220;Wherever has that girl gotten to?&#8221; It would appear she meant Kristiana, for her evident dismissal of the other two who had been mentioned.</p>
		
		<p>Dorian&#8217;s expression remained almost impassive, save for a slight tightening of lips used for the tone directed Joanna&#8217;s way. &#8220;I believe Joanna is currently at dinner. But your concern is appreciated.&#8221; He misconstrued her deliberately, if only for the pleasure of watching her wrestle against the urge to retort with just how little she cared about Joanna&#8217;s affairs, in front of the man that they both claimed for a bond.</p>
		
		<p><em>&#8220;That girl,</em> is right here, dearest, where I was supposed to meet you not ten minutes past. But I see now why you have been delayed, even if I had not had my own means of knowing,&#8221; a cultured, accented voice rang out in greeting.</p>
		
		<p>Kristiana was a story in contrasts. Her pale skin, made artificially whiter for the artful use of powders, was deliberately offset by vibrant lip stain, and a heavier kohl lining of her eyes than was deemed appropriate in this time and country. But then she was not quite British, was she? The ebon mass of her hair was swept up into a mess of curls that were held in check by a gem-studded tiara that looked more like a crown than it should. The brightness of the sunflower yellow, off the shoulder gown that she wore seemed oddly out of place in the dreary colorlessness of a northern English fall. The heaviness of her Russian accent tended to be emphasized in public, as she played to that role of the exotic foreigner who was to be tolerated for her idiosyncrasies; especially now, during the Napoleonic wars. She was the widow&#8217;s companion, and no doubt the pair would soon begin a fashionable trend for such pairings. </p>
		
		<p>Among family, Kristiana&#8217;s accent was a ghost, diluted over centuries and resuscitated only when she felt the need for being dramatic, as she did now. &#8220;Lian, dearest, what a sight for sore eyes you are,&#8221; she lilted. As she closed the distance a beringed hand was already lifting in anticipation for the greeting of her bond.</p>
		
		<p>Lian bowed his head once more to take her hand in his for a touch of a kiss. &#8220;Madame.&#8221;</p>

		<p>A third female voice rose to interrupt. &#8220;Sophie, Kristiana, my dears, it is not so difficult to presume that if your company was wanted it would have been arranged.&#8221; Ayla had a husky voice, often spoken just loudly enough that she might be heard. For the sake of the distance that she was crossing, she had raised her volume. &#8220;Keeping you together is much like herding cats as it is.&#8221; She had known the moment she heard that song where her wards would all be gathering.</p>
		
		<p>As ever, Ayla stood in stark contrast to women who had found a home in that era. She wore the same black dress and spencer jacket and let her hair trail behind her unpinned. She had never curled it and only tied it back in a knot for riding. Like Sophie, she was too tall and built more sturdily than was in season. It was only Joanna among them who seemed to be a fit for the decade, and even her clothing had become outdated for the latest fashions.</p>
		
		<p>The soft taps of footsteps emerged from the shadow of the alley, with Joanna looking little worse for wear, save that her coat front had pulled open. She seemed distracted with fixing the button as she crossed the street, only to give up and let the pelisse flap remain as it was. &#8220;He was quite drunk,&#8221; Joanna offered to the gathering. Her tone came off almost cheerful, despite that her expression did not match.</p>
		
		<p>Kristiana&#8217;s attention redirected to Ayla. &#8220;How cruel, Ayla. Herding is such a crass word. Not all of us are cows incapable to fixing our bibs after a meal.&#8221; Her smile was a sweet stab of a knife meant for Joanna. &#8220;But children will be children. It is hoped that they grow up eventually to be permitted to the adult table, no?&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Well, you are walking well enough, at least&#8230;&#8221; Ayla frowned for the observation, watching Joanna for a moment as if the confession that there had been alcohol in her victim&#8217;s blood might send her toppling over.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Of course. <em>Je suis FranÃ§ai.</em> We know love and wine.&#8221; A beat and Joanna lowered her eyes to her pelisse before turning a half-curve of a smile to Kristiana. &#8220;Ah, but he grabbed my coat and snapped a button. Alas, I am not so seasoned with the men as you, dear sister, that they treat my clothing gently when trying to remove it.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Kristiana&#8217;s dark-eyed gaze flickered over Joanna, the ghost of surprise in dark depths for the riposte to her strike that so rarely came from the fledgling in these encounters. &#8220;Drunk indeed then&#8230;&#8221; was offered as murmured disclaimer to the spark of life in the young bride, before she turned her attention to Dorian. &#8220;Lord Vaughn, so kind of you to see to shaking Lian out of his doldrums. We shall look forward to seeing you both at the castle soon.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Dorian smiled faintly, but it did not reach his eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid for my part, that the ladies may have to do without my company for a while. I have been given charge of organizing the hunt this season. It is more work than I had figured it to be and shall keep me occupied.&#8221; He sketched a bow. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure, however, that Lord Redmond will be pleased to take up his duties again.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Would that my wives kindly suffer one more day of patience,&#8221; Lian interjected, &#8220;And each other&#8217;s company&#8230; I will return to the castle with the daylight and be present.&#8221; A wiser man would have offered to return that evening to soothe the storm he could feel growing more clearly with two hellcats before him. Lian knew that he had no reason to make excuses for absences in his manor, but he found that he was quite unwilling to leave without some notice to Delilah. &#8220;In any case, we have not even begun our own night&#8217;s hunt,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;I will no doubt be the lesser company for lacking.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Ayla took that much for the signal it was. She clapped her hands once, like a matron herding school girls. &#8220;Then we will leave you to your promise, Lian.&#8221; She stared at him for a moment longer before dipping her head in a nod toward Dorian. &#8220;Good luck with planning the hunt, Dorian.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Dorian smiled slightly in response to Ayla&#8217;s wishes, though it managed to be warmer than the greetings that he had spared for Sophie and Kristiana earlier. &#8220;I suppose there must be a first time for everything, even in half a millennia. I appreciate the challenge and hope to find you mounted for the chase.&#8221; Ayla was one of those few in their family old enough to endure a day of the sun and was known to be an excellent horsewoman. &#8220;Horse the Fifteenth, I believe.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;If the host makes it worth the time,&#8221; Ayla said as she began to turn, setting a hand upon Joanna&#8217;s back to encourage her to move. She was, usually, by far the easiest to manage. However, she still flashed a smile over her shoulder for her farewell to the men.</p>
		
		<p><em>&#8220;Bon courage, Dorian!&#8221;</em> Then, to them both, she lifted her hand to wave. <em>&#8220;Au revoir.&#8221;</em></p>
		
		<p>Joanna received a polite bow from Dorian, and a murmured, <em>&#8220;Mercie,</em> and <em>TouchÃ©,</em> Madam&#8230;&#8221; in a quiet affirmation of her boldness to stand up for herself. A steady, dark-eyed gaze settled on her back as she disappeared into the darkness of the streets with her sisters.
There was a moment of standing in silence that would carry the weight of all that remained unspoken between the two men on the currents of notes whispered in the blood, then Dorian reached out and clapped a hand onto Lian&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I thirst, old friend. Now, we hunt.&#8221;</p>
	
	<p>They did.</p>
