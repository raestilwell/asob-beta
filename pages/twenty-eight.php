		<h1>Chapter XXVIII.</h1>
		<hr>

		<p>Lian Redmond was tired. The only effort he had put forth into hiding the evidence of what he had done was to change his overcoat to hide the bloodstains. That, and he had put a half-hearted attempt into rubbing the blood from his face and neck. For the apathy of his efforts, he still bore the rust-red tinge to his blonde locks, and the crust of brown blood drying on the edges of his features. It was enough, however, that he could walk freely into the streets without drawing undue attention. He had ridden from one side of Easthaven to the other and back into the depths of the forest to his castle, taking no time to stop save to complete his business. When he finally came upon the courtyard and the stables, his mount was frothed with sweat and saliva from its exertions.</p>
		
		<p>He waited in silence in the gathering room, a bundle of silk cloth dangling loosely in one hand. His family took longer to come to him than they ever had. Either they knew exactly what had occurred or the dark organs and violins of his song kept them at bay. Lian, however, had the patience to last lifetimes. Eventually, they would come, and so they did.</p>
		
		<p>They filtered in slowly, quietly, and even Eden kept a wary silence. Yet even when they had all settled, there was one, the youngest woman among them, who was missing. It felt very much like an eternity of time passed, waiting for Angelica to finally arrive. Eventually, however, she emerged. The uncertainty of her expression when she lifted her eyes to meet Lian&#8217;s face lasted all of a heartbeat, before it shifted to the defiant boldness that had been her allure a century before. She lifted her chin, daring.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Your conspirator, Angelica,&#8221; Lian offered, carelessly tossing his bundle to her chest. She caught it in her arms, confusion turning to a dawning realization for what the scent was beneath her face. Rot. The woman fell backwards, hurling the bundle away from her. It was there she sat, watching and trembling as it rolled across the floor and fell open.</p>
		
		<p>Death revealed their kind for what they truly were. There was nothing of the beauty that Victor had held in his second life, to be found in the head now laying on the floor. The face was gaunt, with the skin stretched against the skull so tightly that the shriveled veins beneath were visible. The mouth hung open, its grey gums receded to reveal the sharpness of fangs, and the half-lidded eyes had dulled to a bile-yellow where they stared blindly into the room.</p>
		
		<p>Lian ignored the flurry of reactions from the women in the room, and the silent watchfulness of their brothers, to step closer to Angelica. &#8220;You should be grateful Absalom handed him over willingly.&#8221; If there was anything to be said of the relationship between the Elders of the two covens that claimed territory in Easthaven, it was that they at least respected the old truces, if nothing else about each other.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Mercy, Lian, please,&#8221; Angelica pleaded, shuffling to fall forward on her hands and knees. She bowed her head, her forehead pressed against the ground, and began to sob. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to die, please.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>"Stand up, Angelica."</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t! You can&#8217;t do this to us! You can&#8217;t love us and throw us away into the darkness like we&#8217;re nothing but toys, Lian!&#8221; she begged, lifting her head to look at the others for help. Her eyes found Shar. &#8220;It&#8217;s not fair! It&#8217;s not right! All this for a human! We gave everything to him!&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>There was no mercy to be found in the aquamarine eyes of the elder queen whose protection she sought, or in the blend of expressions in the faces of the younger queens around her. In some, she saw her own fear of death; the fear of her, as if she were a contagion that might blight them with her own fate. In others, especially of Celia and Aziza, she read only shades of sadness, and regret; the pity of elders for the foolishness of youth that had come at so high a price. In the rest, there was the wariness of those who had tred too close to the deep waters that she had allowed to sweep over her. None of her sisters spoke; all knew better than to even try, and her brothers were silent observers of the darkest face of the eternity into which they had been taken. Victor&#8217;s death had all but assured Angelica&#8217;s own. Lian would, by honor of the code, have to make the same sacrifice that he had required of another. Angelica would have to face her justice alone.</p>
		
		<p><em>&#8220;Stand up,</em> Angelica.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>This time, she did as she was told with the mechanical rigidness of one whose body was acting against their will. Her arms were stiff at her side, but her body was racked with the sudden onset of violent sobs.</p>
		
	<p>&#8220;I gave and give everything that is within my power to offer,&#8221; he said, drawing her hair back and reaching around her neck to unclasp the ruby choker. &#8220;You have your wish, Angelica. The mortal will be gone. The price you pay now, however, is not all for her. There are laws written in our blood, older than you or I.&#8221; The jewelry dropped to the ground. &#8220;Conspiring against your sire alone is worthy of death.&#8221; But if her ire had targeted him alone, he could have found mercy. &#8220;That your betrayal spread across coven lines and threatened the pacts that protect your brothers and sisters cannot be forgiven.&#8221;</p>
	
	<p>With those words, it was the eyes of his crowned Queen that found the willpower to lift from the desperation of the defendant, to rest upon the sentence of death that was Angelica&#8217;s judge, juror, and executioner above her. Celia felt the chilling whisper of a winter wind touch her soul. He was going to release Delilah. She absorbed the knowledge of it with her very breath and visited again the meaning of sorrow. Whatever had happened had come at so high of a cost to his mortal, that he would not risk the woman to a repeat of the incident, unprotected by his claim.</p>
	 
	<p>It was then, that Celia realized that Lian must love his Delilah Flowers; the mortal that he had coveted enough to pay for with the price of seasons. He had given his family a freedom undreamed of, for her. He had become a living creature again for Delilah&#8217;s breath on his song. And now for her sake, he was consigning himself to a slow death, again. Celia held no misconceptions. Hers was a duty to keep death at bay, it would be another&#8217;s to bring life. It could have been Delilah Flowers — it should have been. Angelica, foolish child that she was, had delivered them all again to hell, and one now, in which they did not even have a hope of the making of music with their Lord for a solace. The Queen&#8217;s steel-gray gaze rested on Lian&#8217;s bloodied features, and she grieved for his loss. For the loss they would all suffer. He was presiding over his own death sentence.</p>
	
	<p>Lian&#8217;s fingers lingered in Angelica&#8217;s hair, as tender as a lover. He brushed it over one of her shoulders and cradled the back of her head as she opened her throat to him. His other arm looped around her waist, pulling her in close; although aside from her tears, she could not fight him. He bowed his head. In silence, he pierced her and began to drain her.</p>
	
	<p>He felt her heartbeat slowing and with it, her song began to fade. That awareness, more than anything else in those moments, began to burn him. The fire raged through his veins, tightening every thread of his body and soul with a pain that he had not known before. As quickly as it scorched him, it began to fade into an icy numbness as he took the last drops of her blood. He heard her last notes, and it was her final heartbeat, her final note that splintered him. </p>
	
	<p>The coven was a shared bond, an eternity of threads woven and interconnected by the heartbeat of the Elder. They had known the power of additions to their harmony; never had they endured the loss of a song. Never had they tasted of the awareness of silence in the place where a familiar chord had hummed. Never had they tasted the pain and fear of ending that reverberated like a silent, internal scream along the threads that bound them together. It was more than some could bear. The sound of a single, soft sob, broke the quiet — Noelle. It was Joanna, as pale as moonlight who reached out to squeeze her hand, through the anguish of the moment.</p>
	
	<p>Shar felt when Angelica&#8217;s song faded to silence, tasted the fear of death in her sisters and brothers, and knew that Lian had moved one note closer to the darkness that would set them free. She released the breath that she had not known she was holding on a sigh of satisfaction for his suffering.</p>
	
	<p>Lian drew back, shuddering. It took him a moment, holding Angelica&#8217;s lifeless and shriveled body against him before he seemed to be capable of moving again. He could hardly hear the songs of the others, not the women or the men, not Celia. Closing his eyes against the threat of the muted quiet, he breathed in. Scooping Angelica&#8217;s remains into his arms to lower her shriveled body onto the sofa, he offered his last directive.</p>
	
	<p>&#8220;See to it that she has a proper pyre.&#8221;</p>
	
	<p>He had exhausted everything in him, and Angelica&#8217;s life sat like a bitter tincture on his tongue and in his core. Yet, he would recover from the loss of one song, just as he would recover from depleting his reserves in the day&#8217;s rescue. Even if both took time, he had not survived as many centuries as he had, without the ability to endure. However, as Lian Redmond turned to take his leave of his castle and his family, he knew there was yet another loss awaiting him. He was not as sure that he could weather the withdrawal he had felt rising in the heart of his rose, or that he could live with the knowing of what would come, what must come, when Delilah Flowers finally recovered.</p>
	
	<p>&#8220;I will return on the solstice.&#8221;</p>
