		<h1>Chapter III.</h1>
		<hr>
		
		<p>There was something almost soothing about the rock of a luxuriously padded coach, Dorian found. The rhythmic sway of the vehicle as it was drawn along behind a team of four of the best-blooded horses that money could buy, was almost enough to lull a man to sleep. Especially when his pocket was heavy with an afternoon&#8217;s winnings and his stomach filled with food that was unnecessary, but pleasant enough to enjoy. That he and Lian had been manipulated into an evening of dining and cards after the track had come as no surprise to him. He had rather expected it and had taken a measure of pleasure in watching Lian unbend just enough to not stand out like a sore thumb among their compatriots; though that was not a difficult task. Two-thirds of England&#8217;s elite were sour enough without the aid of a dreary immortality to make his friend&#8217;s reclusive nature more the norm than the abnormality, especially here in the northern estates. They would likely have to head to London to find the devil may care set that Dorian preferred to run with, and that yearly trip was not due for another few weeks.</p>
		
<p>Dorian was stretched out in a relaxed lounge in the seat that was facing the one his sire occupied, his eyes closed and his fingers laced across his chest. He didn&#8217;t have to have them open to see Lian&#8217;s own pose. A betting man would find low odds in hoping for anything other than that ramrod straight seat, and the unseeing stare that looked out over the passing dark countryside if the Elder had not found some other distraction with which to occupy himself. Mostly, Dorian just listened to the song in his blood. At times, it told the tale of what was going on in his brother&#8217;s heart more honestly than words. It was for the sake of listening to that unspoken story, that Dorian had been silent for the last quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>There was something unsettling about the song in his blood tonight, something that was not quite, but very near to death. It was a cold shadow that wrapped around Dorian&#8217;s heart in the haunting call of an oboe that drifted listlessly on wings that seemed too fatigued to soar any longer. In the shadow of his corner, Dorian opened dark eyes and turned them Lian&#8217;s way.</p>

<p>&#8220;You sing a dark song, old friend. I cannot but admit that I do not enjoy its resonance.&#8221; He paused in the stillness. &#8220;Something has changed&#8230;&#8221; That much was evident, but what, was beyond the Castilian&#8217;s ability to identify. Mind reading was his sire&#8217;s gift. &#8220;Know that I am here if you wish to talk.&#8221; He smiled faintly, &#8220;If I have any gift at all, it is for saying just the right thing in season.&#8221; At least where women were concerned. Except with one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only that I fear I have not the stamina for eternity,&#8221; Lian turned his head, his eyes resting briefly on the Castilian.</p>

<p>He looked back to the window. &#8220;Just as I fear that I can do little else for the song you hear.&#8221; It was all he had to give. &#8220;The silence, were I to fail, would only be too much.&#8221; Lian&#8217;s sire was long dead. There had been a freedom, briefly lived and enjoyed in the independence of being disjointed from his creator&#8217;s song. It had not taken long for the silence to begin to hollow him out, heart and soul. That had been a slow withering, a slow death, and as the years had passed it had become clear that they existed for a deeper craving than what blood could offer. It had only been the chance of a song, heard through a window that had quickened him first, and Lian had learned the secret of that curse: each bond that had been forged in creating brides, in creating Dorian, had brought with it a new song strong enough, that for a season Lian was alive again.</p>

<p>It never lasted. And for all that he claimed he had no stamina for eternity, he was bound in blood to ensure that those he sired never faced such a withering. &#8220;It is always the same after a time. There is only one thing for it, and I am&#8230; weary of their fighting.&#8221; He was as weary of the ones who had learned to flourish without his sun, as he was of the ones who fought for those dying embers. He was weary of his weariness and weary that blood had stopped seeming to sate him. &#8220;Let them fight over dust. I find I am far and beyond caring.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dorian studied Lian&#8217;s profile in silence, thinking, and then a wry twist of his lips surfaced for a return of his smile. &#8220;Have you ever considered, old friend, that you have only yourself to blame for at least one aspect of your predicament?&#8221; It had come to be expected in the half a millennium that they had lived that Dorian was nothing if not frankly honest with his friend. &#8220;I should like to point out&#8230;&#8221; And here, the Castilian affected a flamboyant twist of the wrist in a flourish, &#8220;That I am neither female nor cattily fighting over dust. And yet I dare say my song serves as well as any other to hold the silence at bay.&#8221; He paused, his tone shading grimmer. &#8220;You would have done well to add brothers to our family over the years,&#8221; he ended. It may have served, if nothing else, as a distraction for the brides. There would never be anything but cat fights and the war of body politic in a castle full of competing brides.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not deny this,&#8221; Lian agreed. Dorian was right, of course. There could have been brothers, but it felt that time had passed beyond the ability to rectify that particular situation. He was hardly a decent sire, nor was he a decent head of the family, and he could admit to both of those things. &#8220;I should still make them brothers. They could do with the distraction.&#8221; Although it would mean raising up new fledglings and teaching them to hunt and be clever to avoid attention of humans or hunters. For all that there might have been some salvation in forging those songs, Lian found that he felt more content to wither.</p>

<p>There was a shift in the expression on Dorian&#8217;s dusky features; something that might almost have been pain before it slid away into the safety of the mask that was his shelter. Dorian, as much as any of the women who had been bonded to Lian&#8217;s song, felt that near constant need for connection. It may have resonated more in the whisper of his song, the sound of the waves of a dark river sucking at barren banks, than in anything he might openly say to his sire; but it was a constant companion. It was a void that he had tried to fill with human lovers, and more recently, with the words and presence of one of his sire&#8217;s brides.</p>

<p>It was a twisted sort of torture, to seek solace from one surely as tormented as he by the absence of Lian&#8217;s sun, but Joanna&#8217;s moonlight was a stolen sonata for his mind, if not his blood. It was a secret he had no way of knowing if his sire had discovered. He never knew what was going on in Lian&#8217;s head, unless the Elder shared it. The same could not be said for his own security of mind where his sire was concerned. At any given moment, Lian could look and see right into him. If he had chosen not to explore Dorian&#8217;s secrets, it was more for the sharing of the respect of that privacy than for any lack of ability to do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Careful,&#8221; Lian said to the window, and for a moment it seemed as if he had peeked at his brother&#8217;s hidden heart.</p>

<p>Dorian&#8217;s glance in Lian&#8217;s direction for that single word was almost too sharp, but it was the shift in Lian&#8217;s song, as much as an intuitive knowledge of his sire and friend, that alerted him that the need for care had little to do with their conversation. Where he had been a relaxed sprawl of lean body mass a moment before, Dorian reached up over his head reflexively to grasp at the looped leather strap that was sewn into the roof just over the door and planting his feet to the floor of the cab. In the next beat, the carriage lurched to a sudden stop. It was all manner of inhuman grace that kept the men anchored firmly to their seats.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate it when you do that&#8230;&#8221; It was a good-natured grumble on the part of the Castilian. Truth be told it was far more convenient that Lian was often a step ahead of trouble when it surfaced in their lives.</p>

<p>The voice of the driver was recognizable as he shouted over the sudden raucous disturbance caused by whining, stamping horses. Two demanding voices rose to meet the driver&#8217;s, muffled through the walls of their cab. Lian turned his head away from the window, brushing his hand over the cuff of his sleeve to adjust one golden link. &#8220;I would not suffer this excitement if not for your luck,&#8221; the blonde murmured. Of all the individuals he had ever encountered in his life, Dorian seemed to have the most draw of all manner of fortune â€” good or bad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I aim to please,&#8221; Dorian&#8217;s retort to the complaint came with a flash of white teeth in his dusky features. The darker man reached almost casually into the custom compartment that had been built into the side upholstery of the vehicle cab. The pistol was kept loaded and was needed rarely enough. Dorian preferred quieter means of disposing of trouble, but sometimes one had no choice but to be loud and barbaric. He could feel anticipation building like a storm cloud in his blood. Fools. He spared the thought for the men unlucky enough to have selected the Vaughn transport for their night&#8217;s profit. It would be at a steep cost, instead.</p>

<p>The scuffle of feet dropped onto the path outside, and it took only a moment longer before their carriage door was pried open.</p>

<p>The length of a flintlock pistol was the first to greet them, followed by a cottager with a silk mask over his mouth. The mask was nicer than the rest of his attire, with a cloying scent of feminine perfume that seemed indicative that it was a recent steal.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve picked some rich sticks,&#8221; offered the second masked intruder, appearing over the shoulder of his partner with his flintlock pointed toward the driver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky day at the races, my Lords?&#8221; the first lifted his own pistol in one hand, holding up an old flour sack in the other. &#8220;Quickly, quickly, let&#8217;s get it on then. Can&#8217;t be your first time, can it, gents?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lian&#8217;s eyes shifted from storm-cloud blue to a metallic silver, and he turned his head to face the duo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quicker we&#8217;re in and out,&#8221; the first continued, &#8220;The less likely my finger is to get tw â€”&#8221;</p>

<p>His neck snapped backward before he had finished the word. Neither in the carriage had moved an inch, and were it not for the loud pop and the sudden irregular twist to his head, his partner might not have noticed anything was wrong at all.</p>

<p>"Jer," began the second, hesitant. Jer did not answer. Instead, he dropped, quite dead, to the ground.</p>

<p>The soft click of Dorian&#8217;s flintlock being cocked into readiness echoed in the silence that fell into the place with the collapse of the first body. He pointed the weapon directly at the head of the second, would-be thief. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that Jer is indisposed at the moment for responding,&#8221; his tone was cordial and almost apologetic. &#8220;But I&#8217;m certain that we will do our best to do our best to be accommodating. It is, as Jer so astutely determined, not our first time.&#8221; His wrist bent slightly, nudging his pistol toward the door of the cab in an invitation to their unexpected company. &#8220;Please, join us&#8230; unless you&#8217;d rather join your friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>It had been some time since Dorian had fed his baser appetites, and while the brigand&#8217;s packaging was not quite to his usual tastes, Lian had likewise failed to take care of that particular need. It was not often that the indulgence of a feast of this nature stepped up to the plate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do believe, Lian,&#8221; he murmured, &#8220;that it a terrible crime to look gift horses in the mouth.&#8221; Dorian&#8217;s aim was steady on their unwitting guest, if he was foolish enough to run, or attempt at using his own weapon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such is what I have heard,&#8221; Lian replied. He turned his attention back to straightening the front of his jacket and shuffled sidelong in his seat so that their guest had room to join them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Devils,&#8221; the man stuttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are choosing to make yourself less useful by the moment,&#8221; Lian observed, idly. &#8220;Is it your desire to join your friend on the ground?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dumbly, the man shook his head and lifted his hands, the pistol fell to the ground, bouncing uselessly off Jer&#8217;s back. &#8220;I&#8217;m just tryin&#8217; to feed my family, my Lords,&#8221; he managed, stepping slowly up into the cabin. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a daughter, she&#8217;s been sick,&#8221; the man spoke quickly around the tangle of what seemed to be a thick tongue. &#8220;N&#8217; my wife with a babe on the way. The quarry don&#8217;t pay enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dorian&#8217;s expression shadowed with distaste. &#8220;Do shut up&#8230;&#8221; His tone, if nothing else, could have passed for polite. &#8220;It would have served you well to think twice before deciding to accost the property of devils then, would it not?&#8221; He did not seem to be particularly offended by the classification.</p>

<p>The thief had barely found his way inside, hunched forward, before Lian reached to grab his jacket and jerk him down into the seat. The man lurched along with Lian&#8217;s hold as if he were only a child with no weight or strength of his own. He seemed startled into silence. For the sake of his lower position, the blonde Lord who held him readjusted his grip to hold the man by the scruff of his neck. He bent the thief forward into the center space between the seats.</p>

<p>&#8220;Throat or wrist?&#8221; Lian worked the brigand&#8217;s collar loose and yanked the mask out of the way. For all the blonde was the Elder, the prey had been Dorian&#8217;s choice to take and it would be the Castilian who had first pick of where to bite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wrist. I&#8217;d rather not the stink of rum and dirt for additives.&#8221; In the shadows of the carriage whose door had swung closed with a sharp clap, the Castilian&#8217;s handsome features were already shifting to accommodate the descent of his fangs which glinted wickedly in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Whether it was the slam of the door or the appearance of the monster that he had all but summoned with his words, the thief awoke from his shock to the very real danger in which he had found himself. Whatever he had been expecting of the strangers with the devil&#8217;s powers, it was suddenly all too real. The body in the suspended hold began to scream; a wild, feral and blood-curdling sound that threatened to carry on the wind along the coaching road as the carriage lurched into a forward motion again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shhh&#8230;&#8221; Dorian reached out to capture one of their victim&#8217;s flailing hands, the thumb and forefinger nails of his own extending to similarly vicious points. A practiced flex and upward slice of his thumb nail along the tendon of the thief&#8217;s wrist yielded an immediate swell and flow of blood that filled Dorian&#8217;s senses. The urgency of the thirst that had not been slaked to the degree that he was about to indulge in some time increased. &#8220;Such theatrics&#8230;&#8221; he murmured. And yet, even in his hunger, he was aware that Lian&#8217;s thirst would be worst, and of that subtle but still present hierarchy that was established between them. Lian was his sire and Elder. He was to be afforded the right of first access.</p>

<p>Lian could have been kinder. He could have wrapped the man in a cocoon of sleep and paid the price for his blood with a symphony poured into the thief&#8217;s soul. However, all it had taken was the steady dribble of blood down their victim&#8217;s wrist to reawaken the Elder&#8217;s hunger. If the vampire had a thought at all that the scent of rum and dirt would be a deterrent, it did not stop his dive into the thief&#8217;s throat, slicing through the vein there with the sharp, stinging points of his fangs.</p>

<p>It was not long before the carriage was silent once more.</p>
