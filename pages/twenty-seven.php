		<h1>Chapter XXVII.</h1>
		<hr>

		<p>Delilah looked as good as dead. She was as still and pale as a ghost, laid out against the blood-red upholstery of the chaise lounge to which she had been chained in the candlelit darkness. Her dark lashes were closed over cheeks that still bore the stain of dried tears. On her body were the blood-stained remnants of a torn white underdress that had once been pretty. Even soiled it cradled her body with a delicacy that was almost bridal. On her throat and on the pale curve of the swell of her breast, the unsealed wounds of a vampire&#8217;s claim lay branded. The slow drip of her blood from one tourniqueted wrist into a small copper bowl where it rested on the bed was the only evidence of the barbaric attempt of bloodletting that her captor had been pursuing. That and the perfume of her life that hung in the air.</p>
		
		<p>The shadow in the entryway hesitated, before falling over her pale frame. Lian knelt alongside the lounge, letting his fingers drift from her cheek down the length of her throat to search for her pulse. It was there, too close to the wound on her neck, that he felt the slow beating. For a moment he watched her face, thoughtful behind the mask of a blank expression that had overtaken his features, as if he were making a decision. Whatever conclusion he came to, he eased up into a stand. For as gently as he lifted her hand from the rim of the bowl, he all but threw the container to the floor. He unbound her tourniquet and replaced it with a gentle tie of his silk cravat around her wrist in its place. Next came the shackle at her ankle, bent open as if he had putty between his fingers rather than the metal.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; Lian murmured, leaning down to lay his jacket over her. Gently, he drew her up and into his hold, an arm cradled beneath her back and the other hooked under her knees. Delilah did not stir for all of his quiet ministrations. The only evidence that there was any consciousness or life beneath his touch was the soft exhale of a sigh.</p>
		
		<p>He carried her into the light, cradling her against him as one might a sleeping child. There were none walking on the streets of Easthaven, however, who might have thought either of them so innocent. Yet the moment passersby laid eyes upon the bloodied man and his precious burden, they found themselves leveled by sudden, stabbing migraines that left them all but blinded. By the time they regained themselves, the pair, like apparitions, were long gone.</p>
		
		<p>Even Alice was pinned beneath his silver stare when he made it home with Delilah. For all the older woman&#8217;s worry and well meaning, he did not let her touch his rose. &#8220;Ready her a bath,&#8221; he said, instead, carrying Delilah up the stairs and to his quarters. By time Alice began to arrive with pails of steaming water, Lian had long settled with his treasure upon the wooden floor with Delilah secured in his lap.</p>
		 
		<p>Lian held her like a child with a favored doll, her head tucked against his throat and her body clasped to his. He watched with all the silence of a wary predator as Alice filled the bath, up until the moment, in her wisdom and patience, she suggested washing some of the blood from the girl over the sponging bath. That much, Lian had been inclined to do. While the water steamed in the copper tub, he carried Delilah to nestle her in the one of the armchairs available in the bathroom and drew the sponging basin to her feet. That was where he began: gingerly dipping the sponge into the hot water to draw it up the length of one pale leg. He did not undress her yet, or do more to clean the stains from his own body save for what washed into the basin as he dipped the sponge.</p>
		 
		<p>Finally, Delilah began to stir, waking out of the sleep that had been induced in part by the will and the power carried in her captor&#8217;s bite. It was the effort of a flutter of eyelids that was the first evidence, and a slow but flinching attempt made to draw her leg away from the contact that she felt, although she could not see it. Lian drew the sponge back, as if he thought for a moment he might have scalded her. She had not opened her eyes. She didn&#8217;t want to see the walls, or to see the face of the darkness if he had come to take her again. She rolled her head in the direction the wall had been in her memory. Her legs were warm, and wet. It made her stomach clench a little, and she almost wept for the betrayal.</p>
		 
		<p>&#8220;Please&#8230;&#8221; she managed the single word, groggily, huskily. &#8220;No more.&#8221; No more pain, no more pleasure. If she would die, let her die in peace. She could feel the air moving around her neck, warmer than it had since the moment Victor had taken her from the mansion. Her neck felt naked of her hair, and the memory of it falling in chunks to the floor finally broke through the numbness with which she had encased herself. A tear welled and escaped beneath the prison gate of dark lashes. &#8220;My hair&#8230;&#8221; It was a private requiem — a broken mourning for what had been lost. She still hadn&#8217;t opened her eyes.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Delilah,&#8221; Lian whispered, soft as a prayer. &#8220;Look.&#8221;</p>
		 
		<p>Delilah heard his voice and stilled. She grew so quiet that for a moment it was as if she had fallen asleep again. Lian, her knight of misplaced armor. Lian, King of the Monsters. Lian, who the beautiful darkness had said would come for her. Lian, the cause of her suffering. Lian, the source of her joy. She let her eyes lift open to the picture of the man at her feet. Lian, covered in blood. She blinked slowly, twice as if doing so would make the mirage disappear but it did not. He was still bloody, as soaked as if he had bathed in it. He had a sponge in his hand.</p>
		 
		<p>He was the one who had been bathing her feet. Slowly her eyes lifted from his form and moved about the room, touching on the objects and person present. The tub, the small decorative touches that had been all her doing as she had tried to give Lian&#8217;s bathroom more personality in her cleaning. Alice. Dear Alice. She was not in the belly of the beast, she realized slowly. Lian had brought her home. But it did not mean she was safe. They had come twice now, and twice they had failed, but death was an unrelenting pursuit. &#8220;Angelica,&#8221; she closed her eyes again. She was so very tired. All she wanted to do was sleep.</p>
		 
		<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; he said, slowly. Angelica. He had seen her, knew what she had done, just as he knew that she would not live. It was only for Delilah&#8217;s state that she yet lived, now. Lian breathed in through his nose and lowered his head so that his brow set briefly upon Delilah&#8217;s knee. His girl could do little to calm the beast, he realized, not when it had clawed so near to the surface of his psyche that he was all but ready to go to his coven now. Delilah first. He lifted his head. </p>
		
		<p>&#8220;You are hurt,&#8221; Lian said. It was a deeper hurt than he knew could be fixed with balms and rest. Of all the dark gifts that his kind possessed, they alone could bring a mortal beyond a precipice into a darkness of soul where there was no return. He was not so naïve not to know what she had endured. &#8220;&#8230;And bloody still. &#8220;The bath is too hot, yet. Would you like me to leave you to Alice?&#8221;</p>
		 
		<p>She didn&#8217;t know what had happened, why he was covered in blood, but she knew where she had been and where she was now. She knew what she thought she had seen in Angelica, and she knew what she had felt and experienced with the darkness. Even here, covered in blood Lian looked like a halo of light, but she knew that it could not be true, and she knew that she was beyond the will or the power to deal with the lie. She shook her head in the negative, slowly. She didn&#8217;t want him to go, to leave. Bad things had happened when he left. Over his shoulder, as if dismissed by the silent shake of Delilah&#8217;s head, Alice drifted quietly from the room.</p>
		
		<p>Wordless, she stared at him, with eyes too large and haunted, and tinged with sorrow for what she knew she might never fully regain. Yes, wounded. But she was alive, and safe, and she had to know. &#8220;Show me&#8230; the truth.&#8221; It was almost a whisper, and he would have her gaze touching over his features, searching, searching for the monster he had to be, that she could not see. &#8220;I&#8230;&#8221; her fingers curled into her palms and then relaxed again on the armrests of the chair, &#8220;&#8230; won&#8217;t be&#8230; afraid.&#8221; Where was he? The king they so desired and feared. Who was the one who had avenged her?</p>
		
		<p>He reached into his pocket, drawing free her necklace. As gently as though he were handling glass, he took her silk-wrapped wrist to turn her hand over. He pressed the pendant into her palm, before lifting his own to show the shining, raw imprint of the heart on his skin. &#8220;Silver burns,&#8221; he murmured, returning his fingers to her hand. &#8220;Crosses and crucifixes do not. We can walk on your holy ground, and those of us who have lived long enough can face the sun like any mortal.&#8221; As he spoke, he unbound the silk to set it aside, and let his eyes lower to the laceration on her wrist. &#8220;I will not hurt you, and I will not take from you, Delilah.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Delilah had thought that she would not be afraid to face the truth; not after all that she had seen and experienced in her captivity. Now she discovered that there had been a part of the experience that had made the horror of the reality of beasts walking among men, somehow more possible and acceptable. She had been in a den of vice. She had not been entirely surprised to discover that devils were real, there. Here, in the warm comfort of the bathroom that she had cleaned so many times, with the man who had kissed her an eternity of a Christmas ago, the branded heart on his palm was almost more than she could bear, again.</p>
		 
		<p>She could not help the flinch that was a near withdrawal of her hand from his possession as he bared the evidence of her wound to the air. She had not been awake when it was caused, and she was mystified for its discovery. He spoke of crosses, and the sunlight, and it brought to mind the lore that she was vaguely aware of. &#8220;Nosferatu&#8230;&#8221; she whispered. The dreaded vampire. His eyes were on the raw seeming wound, and suddenly she remembered: the fear, the pain, and the pleasure that had come on the throne. She did not know if she wanted to feel any of it again, even from him. She trembled, despite his words of assurance, but she did not try to remove her hand from his hold.</p>
		
		<p>Lian drew her wrist closer and lowered his head, hesitant. His eyes closed, and there was a subtle flinch where he sliced his tongue with his fangs. When he looked up to meet her eyes, his own had colored as silver as the moon. He leaned down, his lips parted slightly so that the faint glint of elongated canines might have been visible. But his fangs did not touch her. Instead, he closed his lips around her cut, and pressed his bloodied tongue to it. He could taste her through the wash of his own blood in his mouth. The sweetness of her song rushed through him like a hymn of piano and flutes, gripped his heart, and he felt as if he had been baptized into life again. He lingered with his lips on her wrist for longer than he should have before he was able to pull himself back. The stamp of the kiss on her skin was as much an apology as it was a silent, unspoken thank you. That was what they had wanted from her.</p>
		
		<p>She watched him with a wary fascination as he revealed his true nature, and his gift to her. It was not Lian that she saw in the silvery glow of his eyes, or in the wickedness of the fang that was hinted at. There, instead, she found a king of beasts, bathed in the blood of his vanquished. In the shiver of awareness that the stroke of his tongue elicited, and the lingering pressure of his lips on her skin, Delilah thought that she had begun to understand what Angelica had lost, and craved so much to have again, that it had nearly cost her life.</p>
		
		<p>The wound began to seal even before he drew back, its edges tingling as if small currents of lightning were running through it, and then there was nothing left but a smear of blood on healed skin. &#8220;I am not worried of you being afraid,&#8221; Lian said, slowly, speaking to her wrist as he lifted the sponge to erase those last traces of the blood. It was a worse sign if she was not, he knew. When he looked up at her again, it was with the grey-blue eyes that she was so familiar with, though framed with the blood staining his skin.</p>
		
		<p>Delilah watched and felt as the damage to her flesh was restored, and curled her fingers slowly, as if to test the strength and security of the healing that he had rendered. So it was true. He was everything that Angelica had said he was; had likely done everything that Angelica had said he had done. There was a long moment of pregnant silence in the bathroom.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Who is Celia?&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;My Queen,&#8221; Lian answered, truthfully. &#8220;The first I turned and the first I loved. In the five hundred years since, I have taken more. One brother, one sister. Too many queens. Until two days past. Now it is only she.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Delilah&#8217;s lavender gaze flickered with something close to sadness before she retreated in her mind and heart from the currents of the waters there that had threatened to sweep her away. There would be no hiding from the truth, now, any of it. However it made her feel. Five hundred years. Many queens.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an old man,&#8221; There was the ghost of Ms. Flowers who chased frogs, there.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he breathed. It was as if he had tried to laugh but it deflated somewhere on its way into the air. &#8220;I feel it today.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Delilah managed her own tired smile. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t know if you looked it. You are covered entirely in blood,&#8221; her voice when she spoke was equally as weary. It had all been, almost, too much.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;I am sure I look quite like a mortal for how I spent myself.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>She fell quiet for a few moments more, and then moved her hands, slowly, to gather the material of her dress, raising it to just below her knees — an olive branch. He could continue washing her feet, and he did, returning to the easier rhythm of dipping the sponge and cleaning the blood from her. Her legs were pale, save for the places where bruises had colored her calves for her crushing them against the throne. The image of another woman with a familiar smell came to mind, her feelings about this one, a far cry from any other.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Ayla&#8230; She is like you.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;She is&#8230; much more like me than she should be.&#8221; He knew that, too. It was there in the flatness of her song that had begun to fade to a near silence with the years.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;I liked her,&#8221; Delilah admitted. There was something about the woman that had touched her, or maybe it was just that Ayla had saved her life. &#8220;She needs a friend.&#8221; Where that had come from, Delilah didn&#8217;t really know. It was just a feeling she had. There had been a sadness in Ayla&#8217;s solitude. &#8220;Besides her horse.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>"Yes," he agreed, turning his hand over in invitation to take her arm. He started cleaning it next as she allowed, quietly as if in thought.</p>
		
		<p>Delilah fell silent again. The water in the tub she knew, would be cool enough soon to step in. It was likely then that he would leave her. It was what any nobleman would do. But they had already passed all propriety boundaries the moment that Alice had left the room. It was all muddy, in her mind. Lian was an immortal creature. He had a Queen, and a large family, and her; a servant he had been courting, living in his house. She didn&#8217;t know what she was supposed to do, or expect, any more. Everything about the situation was without precedent for the rules.</p>
		
		<p>Her eyes drifted around the room again, and this time, fell upon the mirror present. It was the first time she was seeing herself, seeing what Angelica had done so mercilessly with her shears. She stared at the uneven chunks that fell absent of shape or style around her rounded features and heard again the condescending words; <em>Plain Jane.</em></p>
			
		<p>&#8220;What do we do now, Lian?&#8221; she tried to keep her grief from making her voice quaver. She was ugly and ruined, and Lian was married. What hope, what point, what benefit was there to be had for continuing their pretense of a courtship? It could go nowhere. Angelica was right. He had made his choice. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you want from me&#8230;&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;What&#8230;&#8221; </p>
		
		<p>Lian fell silent. He knew what he wanted. He had known since she had given him the gift of her portrait, kept against his heart. He had known when he had returned home to find her gone in the raw panic that had erupted through him. It had been she alone who he had not plucked from the sweetness of her mortal life, and she alone who he knew he wanted to protect from his eternal prison. He loved her. In all the ways that Celia was the Queen he loved in their darkness, he loved his Delilah for her light and how she made him feel so close to human again that he could love. His Delilah, his rose, wounded more deeply than he could repair. He would have married her, for as long as he could pretend to be the human husband she deserved. He would have been hers.</p>
		 
		<p>It was a fool&#8217;s dream. </p>
		
		<p>So long as she remained a human, he could not protect her in all the ways that mattered the most. All he could do was to free her, and even in that conviction, he found himself wavering. </p>
		
		<p>&#8220;I want for you to take a bath and let Alice help you with your hair, and rest,&#8221; he answered, finally. And she would need rest, if only to recover physically from her ordeal. &#8220;What I want is inconsequential, now. I will not take your choice, Delilah. It is yours to make, and I will accommodate.&#8221; And keep her safe. He lowered the sponge into the red-tinged basin, and shifted to a stand.</p>
		
		<p>It was an answer that was not quite an answer. That he wanted her close, for whatever purpose or reason existed in his mind, was evident. But what that purpose or reason was, was not. Now, she knew what he was, and what he was capable of giving and taking, if he so chose. If Lian Redmond had been dangerous before, he was now even more so. Before, after Angelica&#8217;s first cruelty, she had still had a hope for that renewed courtship, and perhaps, in her wildest fantasies, a marriage. Now, he really did have a wife, a Queen he had chosen. Now, he was no knight in shining armor. He wasn&#8217;t even a man. To stay in his world was to enter a realm of darkness, where death and nightmare seemed unrelenting in their desire to consume her, for the sake of his desires and choices.</p>
		
		<p>All of those thoughts flickered across her features, like so much candle light, as he laid the choice at her feet. It was almost cruel, his inability to decide for them both. It was as if Lian Redmond did not know what he wanted, even for himself. How could she know if she would be willing to live with what he wanted, if he did not know what it was? She would answer all of it, with a single, wordless nod. Yes, she would bathe. Yes, she would attempt at repairing the damage to her hair. Yes, she would rest. And yes, she would choose. He had given her no choice but to.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;I must tend to Angelica and the child she brought. There are none left who would touch you in the light&#8230; and I will be back before sunset,&#8221; Lian leaned forward as if he meant to drop that familiar kiss upon her brow and then hesitated. He offered a smile, small and sad instead, and touched a water-warmed hand to her cheek. With a last bow, he turned to take his leave. </p>
		
		<p>Delilah saw and felt his restraint. His touch was a poor consolation prize, in that moment when she needed him to be decisive. He wanted her, but did not seem willing to fight for&#8230; whatever it was that he wanted. She was suddenly too tired to think, and too tired to feel anymore today. Rest. She needed it, and time to think, and to make her choice. She received his bow, a shorn, silent lamb. There were no words left to say, between them, for now. She didn&#8217;t know what would happen to Angelica and Victor, and she didn&#8217;t think she wanted to know. Some of the secrets of his world were best left as such. She watched him leave, as bloodied and dark as he had ever been a golden knight. &#8220;Goodbye Lian&#8230;&#8221; she whispered it as the door closed behind him, and wondered why it felt like so very final a farewell.</p>
