		<h1>Chapter XII.</h1>
		<hr>

		<p>Delilah was all but buried in a nest of pillows and linen: embroidered pink coverlets and pillows to be precise, although she had resigned herself to permitting the plain, cream sheets beneath. That a room in Lian Redmond&#8217;s house had needed a makeover before it was comfortable enough to be home for the woman was a given. For all the rules of propriety, she was certain that Lian had remained unaware of what she had done to the space. That had all come to an end after her accident a week past. The Lord of the manor had become a consistent and persistent guest to her chambers to hover in a manner that had resulted, on at least one occasion, with a pillow being tossed at his head.</p>
		
		<p>She had replaced the old, heavy draperies with cream-colored sheers that let in both sun and moonlight at all hours of day and night. The same cream-colored material had been cut and trimmed into swatches to be draped, wrapped, and twisted around the various bits of the gold-gilded, off-white furnishings in the room. These were likewise tied down with ribbons in pretty, complementary pastels that were decorated with sprigs of flowers. Those had taken some effort, given the onset of cooler weather beyond the walls of the manor, but Henry had been a wonderful co-conspirator in the theft of blooms from the manor conservatory. Delilah had been responsible for the inner layer of pink sheers that now accented the darker headboard draperies of her queen-sized bed (which was quite the largest bed that she had ever owned in her life). The warm, golden light of lamps on her bedside table, created a coziness to the bower that was a welcome retreat for the serving maid. Her room always carried the faint fragrance of sunshine and spring that seemed to linger around Delilah herself, and it was present now, as she stared at the tray that had been set across her lap on the bed.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too much Lian. I won&#8217;t be able to fit into my dresses by the time you let me out of bed if you keep this up,&#8221; she grumbled. There was a hint of exasperation in her tone. Over the course of her week in bed, she had become more relaxed and informal with the Lord who insisted on the idea of courting his maidservant from between her sheets. She had not ever encountered a more scandalous idea. Evidentially, Lord Redmond was not to be denied access to any part of his home, even though it was quite inappropriate to be spending time alone in a lady&#8217;s room. She had tried ignoring him, bullying and badgering him, shouting at him, and literally begging, for her peace, and yet he had come, every day, a sometimes silent, but always polite, shadow. Always, there was that intensity of observation in his storm cast gaze, and an infinite tenderness in his touch as he examined her wound.</p>
		
		<p>That adventure had been minimized, now, to a thin line of stitching that could be hidden under the curls of her bangs with careful hairdressing, and the occasional dull headache that manifested only when she was feeling stressed. Lian had occasionally been the source of that dull throb in these last days but had been the consummate gentleman in offering suggestions for her relief. At the moment, her hair fell freely in dark, luxuriant waves and hid what little of her white, lace trimmed nightgown could be seen. She had been prepared for bed, and so was suffering through the relative embarrassment of knowing that Lian could see the creamy expanse of her arms clear to her shoulders where the straps of her gown peeked through her hair.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s too late for dinner! It&#8217;s almost nine of the clock!&#8221; She had thought she had escaped the insistence that she eat like a horse tonight, for his failure to show up at his usual, earlier hour, and had nibbled instead on some crackers and cheese procured with the aid of Alice. It had barely been enough to sustain a bird, and she was certain that the retainer had outed her pecking to her employer, which was why she was faced with this monstrosity of a plate now.</p>
		
		<p>Lian was the recipient of a stubborn glare from a pair of lavender eyes, then, as she dug in for the protest she was certain she would lose, anyway. She had found that she could never bring herself to say no to him.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; no,&#8221; Lian returned in what appeared to be his attempt at mocking a feminine wail. &#8220;Nine of the clock.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Delilah&#8217;s glare became a veritable glower. &#8220;You would do well, my Lord Redmond, to consider that I have a very full plate of ammunition. And that I am quite skilled at cleaning a mess&#8230;&#8221; She picked up an empty fork and pretended to jab it into some part of him. He could be quite insufferable when he set his mind to it, but were she to be honest, their banter made her heart sing for the realization that what they appeared to be forging was so very real. If she were not careful, she would make the terrible mistake of falling in love with Lord Redmond. The thought had her turning her attention to her plate again with a resigned sigh, and she stuck her fork instead, into a mound of potatoes and gravy.</p>
		
		<p>He had become a fixture on the armchair in her room (one that he swore was pinker than he ever remembered purchasing). There was the hint of a smirk, and once he was sure she had begun to eat, he let his eyes return to the book in his lap. It was only for the pretense of reading, of course. Delilah had not been shy about making him aware of when his staring had grown to be too much. He thumbed a page over, continuing &#8220;Pity someone decided not to eat earlier, then&#8230;&#8221; It was the only way he had known for over six hundred years to recover, although if he had made the connection that mortals did not heal by feeding in the same way he and his kin did, it was not evident in the trays he continued to bring for her.</p>
		
		<p>That someone rolled the violets of her eyes and swallowed. &#8220;Perhaps because &#8217;someone&#8217; is of an age not to have to eat her greens because the nanny says she must,&#8221; she mumbled under her breath. But she had picked up a knife and had started to cut into the thickness of a carved slice of roasted chicken breast.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;It would be a shame to have to buy you new dresses.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;I am sorry that my attire displeases you, m&#8217;Lord. It is the best that I have been able to afford on a servant&#8217;s salary. I have enough saved to purchase a new day gown,&#8221; she said quietly, setting her tray aside on the bedside table. She had lost what was left of her appetite.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;I meant, Ms. Flowers, that I should be pleased to buy you new dresses,&#8221; Lian said, managing to keep his expression even. &#8220;It would make me quite happy to do so, although I have never found your old attire to be anything less than flattering.&#8221; He sighed. &#8220;My words sometimes do not match what my mind means. It is a dreadful flaw that I shall work to amend before I next cause some offense to your wardrobe or figure.&#8221;</p>

		<p>She managed a smile for him then, and it almost reached her eyes. &#8220;Has anyone ever told you, my Lord Redmond, that you are the most difficult of suitors?&#8221; He could not be blamed for his want to speak truthfully. It was one of the many things about him that charmed her. She could trust him to be honest, even if it were sometimes painful to hear it.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Yet another flaw,&#8221; he admitted, the half-curve of a smile returning. He gave up on pretending to read and folded his book closed. &#8220;That one, however, I think may be far more difficult to overcome. I am appreciative that you have been accommodating.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>She smiled again, and this time it was warmer and wry, &#8220;There are many things about you, my Lord, that make the flaws more tolerable. I shall dare to hope the same can be said of myself,&#8221; she said gently. She knew that she was far from perfect, and far from what a man of his standing should reasonably be expected to desire.</p>
		
		<p>Lian glanced to her tray. &#8220;You are finished?&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Yes, I believe I am. The hour is late. If I eat any more I fear I shall be unable to sleep.&#8221; There was already the threat of that circumstance looming on the horizon. It was a good thing that she had the book she had been reading this week while in bed to finish. &#8220;Goodnight, Lian&#8230;&#8221; she offered the polite indicator that she was desirous of her own company again. &#8220;Thank you for visiting.&#8221; Even if he had come with an unwelcome offering. She had missed him when he had not come earlier. &#8220;I am hopeful to be out of bed in the morning. Alice says that I should be able to return to a gentler service without harm, and I admit that I am tired of this bed.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Lian answered with only a small smile. He stood and leaned over her. The kiss he left on her forehead was the same as it had been every night, soft and cool as a flake of snow just above the arch of her brow. &#8220;Goodnight, Delilah.&#8221;</p>
