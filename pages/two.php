		<h1>Chapter II.</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>Easthaven&#8217;s boundaries had expanded since its founding to absorb the increasing populace. When one of the most recent maps had been drawn, the new line marking what was town and what was not, enclosed one particular residence within its borders. So, the old house sat on the outskirts of Easthaven; a relic of a time when Gothic architecture had begun its revival. The red brick had begun to darken and pock with age, but the elegant crown moldings that decorated the arched windows and door frames had been restored to nearly white in the past years. The freshened fa√ßade did little to hide the years from the bones of the house, and it did not take long for creeping ivy to reclaim the brickwork. The vines reached almost as high as the steep gables so that in places the house seemed to blend with the garden at its front.</p>
		
		<p>Business brought the carriage rumbling down the paved pathway before the old home. Lian did not wait for the driver to step down to open the door before he exited the cab himself. He was as beautiful in the sunlight as he was in the darkness. He wore a black suit with a gray vest, and the blue silk-puff scarf at his throat provided the only splash of color in the ensemble. The Lord was not an unfamiliar figure in that house. He let himself in without so much as pulling the bell. The middle-aged butler, bearing only a hint of silver along his chestnut hairline, finally caught sight of Lian as he passed the depth of the foyer.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;I will be in the study,&#8221; Lian offered and lifted the leather portfolio case that he had brought without a look in the servant&#8217;s direction. The announcement was all it took for William to stiffen his back for a sharp bow and turn to fetch the master of the house. It never seemed to matter, of course. For whatever reason, Lord Vaughn seemed to know when Lord Redmond was on the premises.</p>
		
		<p>Lian was the first in the study and was content to make himself at home. He spared the homeowner some due measure of respect and sat in the guest&#8217;s chair rather than taking the plush, high-backed armchair behind the desk. However, if respect stretched any further, it was not made obvious. The blonde&#8217;s long fingers picked across the scattering of knickknacks, nudged the lid off a gift box to pilfer through and look at the first page of poetry nested within, and finally set his leather portfolio upon the desk to begin unpacking the financial paperwork within.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;One of these days, old friend, you will be the death of me for actually pulling the bell cord.&#8221; The voice that accompanied the steady fall of footsteps against the surface of polished wooden floors carried a blend of flippant amusement and dry resignation. Dorian Vaughn, as dark as his company was golden, still carried enough of his Castilian ancestry to be considered exotic in the staid parlor rooms of the Regent&#8217;s England. It was a fact that he was only too aware of and played up to his advantage.</p>
		
		<p>His ebon locks were trimmed into a style just long enough to be worn free without needing to be pulled back, but wild enough to hint at the Lord&#8217;s inclination to entertainment and play. The top hat held loosely between the fingers of one hand, and the sharp, clean cut of a tailed jacket would be the elements of his attire that betrayed that he had been preparing to leave his home. &#8220;Ah, you&#8217;ve brought your satchel. I suppose it was too much to hope that you had actually come for a visit. If I was of an unsteadier constitution I should begin to think you only loved me for my money.&#8221; A flick of his wrist as he spoke sent his hat flying at the precise angle to catch and whirl a dance around a hat hook perched atop a coat rack at the door.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Well, it is certainly not for your wit.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Dorian feigned a hurt look in Lian&#8217;s direction that faded as quickly as it emerged. He didn&#8217;t seem to be particularly put out to be obligated to a change of plans. He closed the distance to the desk, moved behind it, and almost too casually moved the box containing the pages of poetry out of Lian&#8217;s reach with a beringed hand. He lowered himself into the chair and raised his legs to rest them, crossed at the ankle, on the surface of the desk as he leaned back.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;You look almost human&#8230;&#8221; Dorian offered helpfully, tenting his fingers against his chest. The slightly less than perfect beauty in the light of day was a sign that a vampire had not fed in some days.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Nor your powers of observation,&#8221; Lian added dryly.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Sparse pickings?&#8221; Dorian was not quite so particular in his feeding habits, but Lian was known to be selective.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;I have simply been without the inclination.&#8221; Lian picked up his portfolio. It would not matter. With time came the thirst that thinned the veins and burned the throat with desperation. There would be no denying the call, soon.</p>
		
		<p>With a shuffle of parchment, Lian pulled a thick sheaf of documents free. &#8220;Unless you would like to bequeath your share to your partner and his lineage, you are to be dead in a year or two. And I could not help but notice that Dorian Vaughn the younger has not been properly willed his due inheritance,&#8221; the blonde offered with a raise of his brows. &#8220;When you have the time to take it to the courthouse, I would certainly rest easier knowing there are no kinks in your imminent demise.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Lian extended the papers for Dorian to take. &#8220;And I need to marry.&#8221; As if he did not have enough brides, although none of them counted for a public record. It had come to be quite fortunate that coin now spoke as loudly as it did. It saved both men from having to take one of the castle brides for a faux wedding, and Lian the infighting that seemed to rise along with it.</p>
		
		<p>Dorian leaned forward, distracted for a moment out of his cavalier posture by the reminder of the business that had closed in unawares. On paper in this lifetime, he was almost eighty. &#8220;Good God, is it that time already?&#8221; He muttered as he retrieved the documents. He did not spare time to look through them; it was not the first time that they had gone through the action after five centuries of friendship and almost as many of partnership. Their shared enterprises had both profited from and echoed the world&#8217;s development.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;It creeps up quickly.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not surprised that getting wed would slip your mind,&#8221; Dorian answered. &#8220;I should think most sane men would get tired of looking for a wife after the&#8230; how many is it now?&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Nineteen.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Dorian managed to withhold the sympathetic grimace that threatened for Lian&#8217;s detached reply. The Elder&#8217;s garden had bloomed with more delights than Dorian had had the fortune to see gathered in one place, even for his haunting of centuries worth of society parlors. But there was only so much beauty and perfection that a man could stand before even perfection became a bore, and he had seen the effect of it wearing on his friend in the last half century. He worried for Lian. Were it not for the weight of the secret he carried so close to his heart as to not even admit its truth to himself, he might have set himself properly to thinking of ways that he could help. He could feel the cold silence that pressed into his sire through the reverberation of the Elder&#8217;s song into his own soul.</p>
		
		<p>Lian shifted and folded his portfolio closed, &#8220;If you have other business to attend, we need not concern ourselves further. The storm delayed the mail, and I have nothing else with which to trouble you with, my friend.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;I am always glad for your company, Lian.&#8221; That truth was stated openly. Dorian was not sure that he would know how to live without the song now. It was as familiar to him as the breaths he took. Lian had saved his mortal life in giving him immortality, and for that Dorian owed loyalty and a steadfast bond that could never be broken, would never be broken. Least of all by a woman who wove magic with words.</p>
		
		<p>Dorian swung his feet to the floor. &#8220;You know better than to ask if my preference is for work or play.&#8221; His grin flashed white. &#8220;I was off to the races, I&#8217;ve put down a pretty penny on Walmorth&#8217;s three-year-old black. You should join me. It would do you the world of good to take in a round of entertainments. What&#8217;s the point of living forever if you cannot be bothered to enjoy it?&#8221; He adjusted the links of cuffs that had skewered out of place for his lounging.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Ah, my friend,&#8221; Lian breathed the sigh. &#8220;There is no point.&#8221; Even as he spoke the words, however, he pushed to a stand. It was a rare occurrence that Lian denied Dorian anything, least of all his company when it was invited. &#8220;Unfortunately, I and my coin are at your mercy.&#8221; The blonde did little with keeping up with the races or current events, save what might affect filling out their share certificates. He had brought no hat, but he spared the moment to pull his coat straight. &#8220;There will only be you to blame if we fall into ruin and must live as paupers in the street.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Lian paused and added, &#8220;And it will be you sharing the side of the road with the queens.&#8221; There may have been a brief twitch at the corner of his mouth in a rare show of a smile, but it faded in the next instant. &#8220;I could not weather the storm that would arise.&#8221;</p>
