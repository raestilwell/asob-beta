		<h1>Chapter XXII.</h1>
		<hr>
		
		<p>Henry had every intention of leaving for the market the moment he finished tacking up Rouge; however, the sound of approaching hooves cut those good intentions short. He did not recognize the blue, but once he&#8217;d squinted, he did recognize the girl seated at the front of the mount. &#8220;Oh! Delilah!&#8221; He called out the surprised greeting, lifting his cap from his head to offer a wave. He could not help the pull of his wrinkled mouth into a tight little line, however, for the sneaking suspicion that there was only one reason that she would have arrived earlier, and on an unfamiliar mount. There would be no hiding the pinch of his thick brows in concern, as he moved to meet the women.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Everythin&#8217; alright?&#8221; he asked, lifting his arms so that Delilah could rest her hands on his shoulders in support for her trip to the ground. It was a fatherly worry that drifted over her, even before he thought to acknowledge or address the second woman.</p>
		
		<p>Delilah&#8217;s heart was beating a little harder for the nervous flutter of anticipation of what was due to come, but she had made up her mind to be as bold and as direct as she could be with all concerned. Now that someone had made an attempt on her life, there was no other choice. &#8220;I am, dear Henry, all thanks to my new friend Miss Ayla, here.&#8221; Her unease, however, was evident on her features. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid there has been another incident Henry, and Lord Redmond will need to be informed.&#8221; That was quieter. &#8220;Miss Ayla, I believe, is an acquaintance of my Lord, and very kindly brought me home after helping me out of the worst of it. You may want to avoid the market, for a day or two if it can be helped. I daresay it will be quite busy.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Henry still had his rough hands on Delilah&#8217;s waist, before they found her shoulders to push her back for a more careful examination. &#8220;We shoulda told him sooner,&#8221; he said slowly, but Delilah did not seem to be hurt. That was most important.</p>
		
		<p>Delilah leaned in and touched an affectionate kiss to Henry&#8217;s cheek, concern for his worry evident. &#8220;Dear Henry, we should have truly, but it was all of my decision and I will not have you and Alice scolded for keeping my wishes.&#8221; Lian she knew could wither a man with but a look.</p>
		
		<p>Before Henry had thought to help Miss Ayla down, she had already eased into a dismount. That would have been the moment he noticed the blood. &#8220;You&#8217;re hurt —&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Do I seem hurt?&#8221; Ayla shook her head and distracted herself with patting down the side of Horse&#8217;s neck. &#8220;Will you tend her? She did so well with one of the harder jobs, it would be kind if you might have a treat to give her.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Yeah, sure,&#8221; Henry muttered slowly, finally releasing Delilah to rub the knots out of the back of his neck. &#8220;You&#8217;d best go inside, then. Don&#8217;t think Lord Redmond&#8217;s down yet.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;He will be,&#8221; Ayla sounded sure of that. She moved ahead of the pair toward the door.</p>
		
		<p>Delilah looked up in time to catch the look that Ayla offered her over her shoulder. Her rescuer seemed to fully expect that she would fall in at her side. However, it was not until the woman paused to wait for her, that Delilah lifted her skirts to make for a swifter pace in catching up to her on the steps.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;I should be surprised if Lord Redmond is yet awake, he is of a habit to come down closer to the noon hour,&#8221; Delilah had almost called him Lian, for their months of comfortable familiarity now, but she remembered that to all the world she was yet but a member of his employ. &#8220;I shall have to find Alice and see if she will go up to rouse him.&#8221; She reached the top of the circular stone stairway where Ayla waited, and took a step ahead of her to cross the threshold into the cool and shadowed interior of the grand foyer of the manor. The two women had not walked three steps before Delilah came to a stop so abruptly that Ayla all but took a step right into her back, the contact causing a flicker of discomfort to skitter over her sculpted features.</p>

		<p>There was a soft clatter of metal hitting the floor beneath Ayla&#8217;s skirts, and a small, metal ball came rolling out across the wood to collide gently with Lian Redmond&#8217;s boot. He stood just beyond the entryway of the foyer, at the foot of the stairwell that led to the upstairs, with eyes on Ayla that held a quiet intensity. That he stood only in an undershirt and black, brushed breeches was telling that he had still been in his quarters up until a few moments before. Without a word, he crouched to pluck the ball up between his index finger and thumb. Despite his silence as he rolled the metal over his palm and the neutral cast to his face, his growing fury seemed to be all but rolling from him. His eyes were a brief flash of silver, then blue that lifted to touch first upon Ayla and then to narrow on Delilah in that pinning study. That she seemed to be uninjured was the reason he could control his tone when he asked, &#8220;What happened?&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;A man was in the market with a pistol.&#8221; Ayla offered, far too nonchalantly. &#8220;Now he is dead and everyone is secure. Your girl was very brave.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Lian looked for a moment as if he were in physical pain. He lifted his hand to massage the space between his brows. &#8220;Ayla.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;It is what happened. As to what may have started it, it is not I who could say.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Alice&#8217;s arrival from the kitchens into the foyer where the small company was gathered was preceded by her voice, filled with a hollow regret when it spoke. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had a knowing all along that it might come to this. I told Henry, t&#8217;was past time that you were told. After the birds, we should have done it.&#8221; She made her approach, wiping the flour from her hands into the skirts of her aprons. &#8220;It&#8217;s been months now, of strange happenings. Someone has been trying to put the fear of death into our Delilah.&#8221; She set her gaze upon Delilah with something close to fearful concern in her matronly expression, though whether it was for the girl or for fear of the consequences of her own indecisiveness to act, was not immediately evident.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t want to be bothering your lordship with matters below your station, as it was of a tangle amongst our kind,&#8221; Alice concluded. Lian would understand, she knew, that she spoke of the common folk. The soft click of the door closing announced Henry&#8217;s arrival, along with the heavier shuffle of steps as he closed the distance to the group. Alice met his eyes for a moment before her gaze shifted back to Lian. &#8220;But after the birds, we should have told your lordship, and for that, I&#8217;m begging your pardon, m&#8217;Lord.&#8221; Sorry was a weak word for the anguish of guilt that Alice felt in her heart. Her Delilah might have come home in a box, this day, were it not for a stranger&#8217;s kindness, and she did not think that she could have lived with herself if that had happened.</p>
		
		<p>Henry twisted his hat where he held it, watching Alice and then watching Delilah as if he had not quite been satisfied amid his searching that she was truly alright. &#8220;Sorry,&#8221; he said, quietly, although his apology seemed to be directed to the girl. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have left you to the market alone for knowin&#8217;. We knew how bad it was gettin&#8217;.&#8221; Just not that it would escalate so far. He turned his head toward Lian and bowed. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, m&#8217;Lord.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Lian, however, had flattened his hand against his eyes as if to block out the sight of all of them. Finally, with a sigh, it dropped to his pocket. &#8220;You,&#8221; He looked back to Ayla. &#8220;Is the pain lingering?&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Not for much longer. That was the end of it.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Good. Thank you, Ayla, truly. Go borrow the bath in the upstairs east wing. I will send one of the maids to prepare water for you. I do not think there are any dresses that will fit you, but perhaps something can be found.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Of course. I should like a word later, Lian. And my jacket.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Yes, so you should.&#8221; As he imagined that there was far more she should like to speak of. However, he had turned his eyes away from her before she had begun to walk to the stairs. &#8220;Alice, go make tea. Henry —&#8221; Lian paused and frowned. &#8220;Help Alice with the tea, I am sure everyone is in need of something to calm their nerves. And you —&#8221; He looked at Delilah, then. &#8220;You will stay here for a moment.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>Delilah admitted herself for a coward. Standing there swallowed in the shadows of Ayla&#8217;s jacket, she looked and felt like a child out of place in adult company. It didn&#8217;t help that she could feel how very disappointed Lian was with them all. Her own guilt and despair for her role in the entire mess had been swelling inside of her for each passing moment, confession, and apology. She would not be able to help the sheen that caused an unnatural brightness to the lavender gaze that was a little dilated for the after effects of shock and the darker foyer.</p>
		
		<p>For the sake of something to do while waiting for Alice and Henry to melt away, she began to work her way out of the jacket and then held it before her and between herself and Lian as if it could protect her from the consequences that might come. She lifted her chin then and met his gaze when it found hers. She tried to smile reassuringly, but it wavered, trembled, and then melted away. Someone had tried to kill her. Someone had hated her enough to want her dead, and the thought left her numb inside.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry, Lian,&#8221; she managed a shaky whisper before the first tear slipped down one cheek. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think&#8230; it would come to&#8230;&#8221; She shook her head, the distress of the nightmare finally released for expression in her eyes. She had swallowed every insult, every threat and had somehow managed to compartmentalize her fear and her vulnerability. &#8220;I thought I was&#8230; I thought it would stop. I didn&#8217;t want you to worry.&#8221; She took a shuddering breath that was almost a sob. &#8220;The fault was mine, please don&#8217;t scold them.&#8221; Alice and Henry.</p>
		
		<p>He placed his hand on the back of her head, pulling her into his chest, and held her against him, lowering his face so that he could rest his lips atop her crown. Delilah did not resist his hold. There was nothing she needed more than the solid feel of his strength, and the feel of the beat of his heart under her fingers where she had curled them tightly into his shirt. It was all that she could do not to break down into uncontrolled sobs, but she had all night and the privacy of her room for that. Shifting, Lian nudged the curl of his fingers under her chin to turn her face up to him. &#8220;I am glad you are unharmed,&#8221; he murmured. His expression was a blend of worry, a touch of sadness, and that quieter tension from the restraint that he was showing. She would scold herself enough without him adding to it. Instead, he leaned forward to touch a kiss to the corner of her eye and another to her temple. &#8220;Go drink your tea. Your morning has been a long one.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>All that he had for an answer then, was a mute nod of agreement with his statement. It had been the worst morning of her life. She searched his face, reading the blend of emotions there, and reached up onto her toes, suddenly, to place the lightest of kisses to the corner of his mouth. Color warmed her face. She had fully intended to kiss his cheek. She filled the silence around the moment with all but shoving Ayla&#8217;s jacket into his hands. &#8220;She will be wanting this back&#8230;&#8221; Then, like the coward she knew herself to be, she picked up her skirts and ran.</p>
