		<h1>Chapter X.</h1>
		<hr>
		
		<p>It was the perfect morning for a hunt. November had rolled in with the threat of bluster as the colder air of the river wrestled with summer&#8217;s dying whispers, but the weather had found its identity again. Crisp mornings and sunny afternoons tended to demand a variety of costume changes if one ventured out of doors, but by the mid-morning, there was little need for much more than a shawl on bare shoulders to be comfortable. As such, Lord Dorian Vaughn found himself looking over the busy scene that was unfolding on the sprawling acreage of his mansion grounds with a measure of appreciation for both the feminine spectacle that it provided and for the smooth efficiency with which the event was unfolding.</p>
		
		<p>It had been a full two weeks since his run in with the queens in Lian&#8217;s company, and he found himself wondering if any of them would attend. He was unaware if Lord Redmond had kept his promise to his brides, as he had not even seen that gentleman in the timespan. Between them, there had only been a hastily scribbled note, pleading for the favor of the use of his staff when Dorian discovered that he&#8217;d be expected to provide refreshments. That note had secured the manpower and meal that everyone was currently enjoying.</p>
		
		<p>The light brunch of sandwiches, non-alcoholic beverages, and ciders that had been provided for the participants had been set up on a series of long wooden tables on the lawn under sprawling oak trees. Crisp white linens dressed them up, and they were weighted on their ends by the plates, glassware, and napkins that had been made available for those inclined to sample the fare. Dorian had determined that alcohol before hard riding was a nonstarter on a hunt that he organized, but that fact did not seem to be quieting the excited hum of conversation and interaction that was taking place. Today, a good portion of the lawn was also taken up by the constructed, lightweight kennels that housed two packs of hounds that were already providing a steady background chorus for the social chatter. The glass of lemonade in Dorian&#8217;s own hands was more for show than anything else, but he found himself distractedly sipping at it as he took in the scene.</p>
		
		<p>Dotted across the lawn, and in some cases along the graveled drive in front of the mansion, several participants of the hunt were already mounted, having foregone a sampling of the refreshments. They controlled the dancing of their horses where they were restless, or sat, looking faintly impatient for the real event to begin. Along the driveway, a steady trickle of participants attending mostly for the hunt was still arriving, and there would be fifteen minutes yet before the Colonel, and the Master of the Hounds sounded the horn that would signal the feature event of the gathering.</p>
		
		<p>Yes, all things considered, Lord Vaughn was fairly pleased to admit to himself that his burdensome affair was going off without a hitch.</p>
		
		<p>Lian Redmond had indeed kept his promise. As far as he was concerned, the four days he had spent at his castle among his brides had all but counted for an advance payment with his company. Of course, he also knew his queens well enough to know that they would not be satisfied to let him take extended absences again just for one lengthy stay. It had not kept him from escaping back to his manor. Dorian&#8217;s event was the first that Lian seemed to care at all about attending on his own accord, and so Lord Vaughn had been offered the surprise of the addendum to that return letter: of course, he could make use of Lian&#8217;s servants, and Lian would arrive before the hunt.</p>
		
		<p>Although he had kept that promise too, Lian had not immediately sought Dorian&#8217;s company. He kept to himself, listening between the lull of conversations for the melodies of songs that he could hear. Dorian&#8217;s had been expected, but he heard the muted, somber notes of Ayla&#8217;s music near where horses had gathered and the far more flippant dancing of flute and percussion that was Eden&#8217;s, lurking somewhere not quite seen. It was the distorted twisting of organ notes that indicated the presence of another of his older queens that had been, in part, the reason Lian stayed securely among the mortals. Despite the flourishes of color that dotted the yard, Lord Redmond had kept to his theme of blacks. He wore a black tailcoat with golden buttons over black breeches. The cravat at his collar was of white silk, and it seemed the only pop of color upon him was the yellow waistcoat that peeked out from between the black fabric of his over-clothes.</p>
		
		<p>It took the arrival of one of his own carriages to draw him out of his sheltered place in the gathering. It had not been his preference to take separate carriages, of course, but given that he had invited Miss Delilah Flowers to attend the event, not as a servant but as a lady, Lian had made the effort to keep to some social rules. He had even asked Alice to be her chaperone, offering both she and Henry the day off, rather than lending them to service Dorian&#8217;s event.</p>
		
		<p>In the Elder&#8217;s carriage, Delilah&#8217;s heart was racing at a pace to match that of a fleeing fox as her transport came to a rumbling stop. Why she was so nervous she didn&#8217;t quite know. It was not her first hunt, though she had in her singular experience been relegated to riding on the back end of the chase along with the company that was appropriate for her social standing at the time. Her one and only hunt had been in her eighteenth year, during her first social season. She had even had a suitor be her escort for the event, although his mother had seen to it that they were barely able to spend more than a few moments together when not mounted. Maybe that was why she was feeling so nervous now.</p>
		
		<p>This all felt, far and entirely too much as that affair had. That she could even consider Lian in the light of a suitor caused a skip to her heart again. But how else was she to construe it? He had provided the funds for her to purchase an entire wardrobe for the event, despite her protests that her own worn riding gown would do, and he had insisted that she be brought to the hunt in one of the most luxurious of his carriages with a chaperone. Everything about the situation pointed to a man who wanted to protect the reputation of his company while in the presence of society. That she should have technically been in attendance as a server only made her all the more conscious that she was not. In the carriage, her fingers drifted up unconsciously to close over the heart shaped pendant that was so often her anchor, her last gift from her mother. &#8220;Oh, my Lord Redmond, what in the devil are you up to?&#8221; she whispered it softly to herself. There was no doubt that something was different about him.</p>
		
		<p>That was the thought on Delilah Flower&#8217;s mind when the door opened, and she arose from her seat to be helped down the carriage steps. She could only hope that he approved of the way she had spent his funds in dressing for the occasion. She opted for a two-piece outfit, rather than a single gown, and a periwinkle blue, long sleeved spencer jacket was perfectly tailored to her torso, emphasizing the neatness of her waist and the rise of her breasts. A rounded trident pattern of black buttons led the eyes subtly over the curvature of her bosom, and up her chest to the V point of a stiff black collar that winged out in triangular points in a fashionable accent of her shoulders. The jacket was layered over the fall of a heavy, pleated black skirts and her riding boots were a peek of polished leather beneath. She wore her hair in a practical bun at the nape of her neck but had spared the effort to tease curls out of its confines to fall along her temples to her cheekbones. In a touch of vanity, she had given into the impulse to purchase the riding hat that had been designed to complement the outfit. A black, lady&#8217;s riding hat accented with a periwinkle blue feather sat at a jaunty angle on her head. She had pinched a little color into her cheeks and touched a faint smear of peach lip stain to the soft fullness of her lips.</p>
		
		<p>Delilah would not be able to help the slow, excited smile that spread across her face for the sight of Lord Lian Redmond waiting for her at the end of the steps. It lit up her face with a radiance that caused more than one individual, male and female alike to turn a head her way to notice her arrival. The smile he offered her, in turn, was small, but present. Her fingers closed over his for the support and when she was solidly on the ground she could not help the lean toward him to whisper. &#8220;Very good, my Lord, soon enough I shall actually have a parting of your lips for a smile,&#8221; she teased gently. </p>
		
		<p>&#8220;My face may crack for it.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>The bubble of a laugh escaped her. The last three months had found subtle changes occurring in the routine of the Lord of the Manor. He began emerging earlier and earlier from his daily retreat, and often seemed to find a way to cross paths with her as she went about her work. Always apologetic and polite for the disruption, he still managed, somehow, to remain anchored in whatever room she was working, whether it was to read a book in the library, to play the piano in the music room, or once, even to fix himself a sandwich while she had been in the kitchen. Another time, he had found her walking in the gardens and had deigned to walk with her there for quite a while in that silent way he had about him, until she had prodded and teased enough to provoke a tick of his lips for her effort. </p>
		
		<p>That suggestion of an ability to laugh on his part had been her consummate victory, and it had become her mission in that moment to see him smile. A grin, was her ultimate goal, though she doubted that would ever be accomplished. That it had begun to matter so very much that he learn to smile had been her warning. Really, she should have been better at heeding it, for surely this current circumstance could lead nowhere but to disaster. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Am I unfashionably late?&#8221; she asked as she reached the pavement. &#8220;I think not, I still hear the dogs so we are not yet off.&#8221; Was she supposed to wait for his arm as a lady would? She was still not quite sure how she was intended to act. Delilah knew that it could not be. It just could <em>not</em>, and yet every feminine instinct told her that it was as she suspected. Lord Lian Redmond had an <em>interest</em> in her; in Delilah Flowers, housemaid. </p>
		
		<p>When she had stated those words aloud to her mirror, the idea had been exposed for being precisely the ridiculous bit nonsense that it surely must be. She had all but convinced herself that she was being a silly goose for childish fantasies that her knight might have arrived at last. Then, he had offered the invitation. She was to come to the hunt as a guest as a lady.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;I can assure you that you only missed gossip,&#8221; the Elder answered. He could not repeat the droll if he tried, however. Lian relied quite heavily upon Dorian for keeping track of what was being said. He offered her his arm.</p>
		 
		<p>Delilah&#8217;s uncertainty for her expected role diminished immediately for his extension of his arm. She slipped her own into his crooked invitation, and it was at once as it had been when they had walked in the garden. Her comfort level was evident in the way that she fell into step at his side. There was no doubt for it now; she was here as Lian&#8217;s invited guest and she realized that she had been right. As she had sat in the carriage earlier trying not to fidget under Alice&#8217;s thoughtful gaze, she had had a knowing, in the deepest niches of her soul, that today could change everything. It already had. Delilah quirked a wry smile as she stole a glance of Lian&#8217;s profile.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Is it too late to admit that I have ridden only one hunt, and I am quite halfway to nervous about this one?&#8221; she asked.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;I am not much for the sport, myself,&#8221; Lian said, although it should come as no surprise. If there was anything that a group deemed enjoyable, Lord Redmond seemed to go out of his way to be contrary. &#8220;I will keep close.&#8221; And God willing, there was not some social etiquette that made <em>that</em> unacceptable. Knowing his own fortune, there likely was. &#8220;I will likewise admit that I am entirely and unabashedly unknowledgeable regarding the rules of a proper courtship. If you would but give me the mercy of forgiving and correcting my offenses. I am sure there will no doubt be many.&#8221; Lian paused and spared a slight bow of his head to Alice. That she would stay was likely a given, but she had her own escort in Henry.</p>
		
		<p>Delilah&#8217;s comfort had remained in place throughout his ramble, evidenced by the barely restrained amusement that had curved her lips until he said one word. Courtship. Her finger hold on his arm flexed tighter, subtly, and her feet stopped moving, inviting him to do the same. Her face lifted so that her lavender gaze could search the blue depths of his own, hesitantly. &#8220;Is that what this is?&#8221; she asked softly. There was a pause, &#8220;&#8230;Lian? Are you attempting to court me?&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>She remembered when he had left the manor for several days, sometime a fortnight ago, and the house had become a miserable echoing mausoleum. She had missed his shadowing presence and the way her stomach knotted, just a little when she knew that she might anticipate seeing him. He had done nothing, said nothing remotely inappropriate for their connection as employee and employer. Yet an intensity to his eyes when he studied her in lingering moments of silence had begun to appear more frequently. It had reminded her of the first time that he had looked at her that way in Mr. Curry&#8217;s office.</p>
		
		<p>Always she had felt herself wanting to reach up and touch the place where his eyes rested. She had almost asked him once, what it was that he found to be so very fascinating about her features. All boldness had left her when she met the storm of blue in his eyes, however. She had opted instead to relieve the tension of the moment with another meaningless bit of chatter. Now, she found it in herself to hold his gaze. He was the one declaring his hand, if that was indeed what he was doing. Courtship had any number of implications and she wasn&#8217;t quite sure what he meant by his words. He wasn&#8217;t exactly behaving like a man who had just informed his maid that he was seeking her hand for marriage&#8230; or did he have another type of proposal in mind? Did he even understand what he was saying?</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;You do understand what that means&#8230; right?&#8221; Her lips twitched. Perhaps he meant only to apologize for not knowing how to go on with society manners. &#8220;Because I will admit that it would have been entirely more appropriate to announce your intention to court me before an invitation into the eye of society. That is generally how it&#8217;s done.&#8221; And for all her uncertainty, there was still laughter lurking in her gaze. How like Lian to do it this way. And she found, it could not be more perfect, even if she still had no idea exactly what he wanted of her. </p>
		
		<p>&#8220;I thought it meant that I enjoyed your company and would quite like to continue to pursue it,&#8221; he answered, huffing a breath that could have almost, but not quite passed for self-depreciative laughter. The smile faded to a smirk as he offered an alternative, &#8220;Although if it is your preference, I can certainly return to lurking in rooms whilst you work, and we can consider this a pleasant morning out.&#8221; </p>
		
		<p>Delilah&#8217;s smile grew softer for that admission. Dear Lian, he really knew how to get himself into a pickle. He was entirely lucky, she decided, that she was not the type of woman who would have leapt to conclusions. She knew and fully accepted her place. He had not proposed marriage, nor had he proposed or implied anything more scandalous. All he seemed inclined to explore, was her company, and she found that she could not find it in herself to turn that down. It might be all that she might ever have of a knight, and she could indulge in her childish dreams for the moments that he was willing to offer.</p>
		
		<p>She leaned in closer again to whisper. &#8220;I will admit that you are entirely too distracting when you lurk while I work. I am not earning my day&#8217;s wages for your presence, so I am most happy, good sir to permit you to pursue my company on one condition.&#8221; She held up an index finger for emphasis. &#8220;You must do so on my off days, and you must try not to scandalize Alice too terribly much. I cannot tell you how much I was for withering under her study in the carriage.&#8221; If she was going to have a pretend courtship, she would like it to be as real and enjoyable as the real thing. No one had ever been courted between the dust covers that she was aware of, and it would give her a reason to look forward to her days off. </p>
		
		<p>Again, there was something too intense about the way Lian studied her. He leaned in too, under the pretense that he needed to hear her whisper. He certainly did not, but he rather enjoyed her warmth and the scent of roses that wafted from her. That close, he could hear the soft beating of her heart and that gentler plinking like fingers on a piano that hid beneath it. There was no doubt that he could hear it. Even blended among the flutes, and strings, and low melody of an organ of his brides, that soft, not-quite-melody was all hers. He watched her lips, pressing down on the impulse that threatened. &#8220;Pity,&#8221; he said, finally. &#8220;I rather enjoy distracting you.&#8221; It was all that he could do to straighten, and with that slight distance shook himself from her spell. &#8220;I should be pleased to be patient, then, if such is your only condition.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>There were several sets of eyes watching Lian Redmond that afternoon, for various reasons. That would be the only reason that the existence of Ms. Delilah Flowers came to the awareness of certain individuals. Dorian had felt, almost as much as he had heard a shift in the music flowing in his blood, and it had caused a casual turn of a glance in the direction he had last seen his sire. The arrival of the Redmond carriage when its owner was already present caused a sharpening in his focus on the carriage as it drew to a stop and then the scene had his entire attention when the woman, clearly a lady of some means stepped down from the carriage and leaned in to whisper in some intimate exchange.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Well, well, well, old friend&#8230;&#8221; he murmured to himself as he continued to watch the pair. &#8220;It seems I&#8217;m not the only one keeping secrets&#8230;&#8221; But who was she? Where was she from? And what did it mean that Lian was finally presenting his latest bloom to society? He knew, better than most, the implications of Lian keeping the company of a beautiful woman. And his present company was very beautiful in quite a unique and refreshing way, even from his distance. A soft expletive erupted from his lips then. Had Lian forgotten, or not known? His brides were present, or some of them. &#8220;Let the games begin,&#8221; he offered dryly to the air.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;It was a girl.&#8221; Eden&#8217;s voice emerged from behind Dorian. &#8220;Do you think she&#8217;s nice? She looks alright from here, but the castle has become a henhouse in the worst ways.&#8221; If Eden considered herself part of that henhouse, Dorian found that she had not taken to dressing like it today. There would be no telling where she had found the suit, or who had tailored it to fit her, Eden certainly was no seamstress. Yet there she stood, dressed to the nines and looking for all the world like some young dandy with her top hat sitting lopsided atop her head and tinted spectacles protecting her more sensitive eyes. That she kept her hair cut short only aided the ruse, and just below where one of those corn silk curls fell at her neck, was a hint of a red smudge where some sweet lady had left her mark. Of course, the perfume clinging to her was not at all her own, either. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want another sister. Or the ones I do have throwing their tantrums.&#8221; That was no doubt forthcoming. </p>
		
		<p>Dorian spared Eden and her getup the quirk of a brow, but that would be all he had to offer to the girl that he had seen halfway to socially naked on more than one occasion. She was certainly no maiden today, and he found that he had to reluctantly admit that she made a rather handsome youth. Dorian shifted out of his relaxed lean against a terrace support. Lord Vaughn himself quite looked the part of the sportsman this morning. It was not often that he got to play to that more flamboyant instinct. It was a hunter green tailcoat over a cream vest with brass buttons and black breeches tucked into a pair of highly polished riding boots that marked him for riding in the chase. He had foregone the riding hat, however, and the dark locks of his crown had an already slightly windblown appearance for his elevated perch in the crosswinds of the terrace that wrapped around the eastern side of his residence. He studied Lian and his guest in silence for a few beats longer before answering his sister.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; he murmured. It had been a girl. &#8220;I should have known; the signs were all there.&#8221; His brow furrowed thoughtfully. &#8220;But the devil if I can think of where he&#8217;s been hiding her.&#8221; He could have sworn that Lian had been all but housebound for months. His brows shot up suddenly. &#8220;No. The wily bastard.&#8221; Was Lian keeping a mistress on the grounds of the manor? But why then go through all the shows and formality of a dalliance? &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t make sense.&#8221; He was talking aloud, but more to himself than to Eden. When he realized that fact he tried to focus.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think any of us are of a mind to see another hen in the house,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;And I did not think Lian was either.&#8221; Even more a mystery then, the Lady who had shaken his sire from his apathy. &#8220;She is dressed for the ride; no doubt we shall have occasion to meet her before the day expires.&#8221; There seemed to be an intense conversation happening between the pair, and he was not inclined to interrupt. Besides he had responsibilities. &#8220;Stay out of trouble Eden&#8230;&#8221; was his low-spoken warning to the girl to tread lightly. &#8220;And find your mount, the horn will sound any moment.&#8221;</p>
		
	<p>&#8220;Augh,&#8221; Eden groaned. &#8220;I&#8217;m shyte for a ride.&#8221; There had been only one reason that she had come out of the castle at all, today. It had certainly not been for a fox hunt or to watch Lian flirt. &#8220;And your Master of the Hounds looks as if his heart might quit him trying to blow the horn.&#8221; Even as she spoke the words, however, the girl was straightening her hat and stepping backward. She&#8217;d ride a bloody horse, then, but only because she likely cut a far more dashing figure atop a mount.</p>
	
	<p>Some distance away, on the perimeter of Dorian&#8217;s lawn, a woman sat with a regal pose atop a sorrel mare with a blaze down its nose. Shar&#8217;s riding gown had been inspired by the military officer style that was all the rage with uniformed men moving throughout society during the height of the continental war. It was a deep, navy-blue with trims and overlays of golden cording that decorated her chest from waist to shoulders and trimmed a high round stiff neck collar. The overdress neckline parted on a plunging V that would have been scandalous were it not for the almost demure high-collared white blouse underneath. The ensemble was capped off by a black ladies riding hat, naked of any decoration. She looked almost militant, which suited Shar&#8217;s mood just fine. She had little cause, care or reason to be seductive anymore.</p>
	
	<p>Unlike Sophie and Kristiana who seemed to thrive in the relative freedom attained by their independence from Lian&#8217;s song, each passing day, year and century only served to increase her bitterness and her hardness of heart regarding her fate. Immortality was her prison, and Lian was her warden. That he had continued, blithely to collect prisoners over the centuries had stung; less for the fact that he&#8217;d lured another innocent into her fate, but more for the fact that whatever terrible hope she had for ever recapturing what they once had had, faced a more and certain demise with every bloom that he added to their garden. At some point, surely, he would stop and return to those treasures he already had.</p>
	
	<p>The answer to Shar&#8217;s question was in front of her eyes, now, strolling in her bond&#8217;s personal company — company that his own wives had all but had to kidnap him for. Now it made sense, the extended absence, the apathy and disinterests in their comforts. After a hundred years, Lord Redmond had finally found himself another victim. The twist of emotion in her gut was strong, so powerful that it almost caused her to shake atop her mount, and a single, harsh malevolent chord sang out in her blood to accost the heart and mind of her sire. In that moment, Shar thought that she hated him. But under the power of that violent emotion, rang the truer chord of desperate desire. It was a twisted, warped melody of light and darkness, that only settled into a steady flow of dark water, the longer she let her aquamarine gaze rest on the woman in Lian&#8217;s company.</p>
	
	<p>&#8220;It was not so difficult to know,&#8221; Ayla murmured from atop her own, blue roan. Her dark eyes were set upon the older queen. She did not need to hear the dark music in Shar&#8217;s blood to read her sister&#8217;s emotions. There was little more than twenty years&#8217; difference between them, but even that marked Shar her senior. &#8220;I am sure you will hide your song less than you have hidden your expression, Shar.&#8221; If that even mattered to the woman. Of them all, Shar had grown the most hardened over the centuries. That Ayla had been the bride who immediately followed Shar&#8217;s reign had done nothing for their relationship. Over four centuries later and there were still only those smoldering embers between them. There were new queens for Shar to divvy her hatred among, and Ayla had eventually settled into her own apathy for the eternity that awaited them.</p>
	
	<p>Shar turned a piercing gaze in Ayla&#8217;s direction and did nothing to change either her expression or the ripple of dark water that was intermingling with Lian&#8217;s answer. &#8220;Keep your advice and your admonitions, Ayla. At least I can say for myself that I still have something left to feel. Far better than to wither to a husk of a soul.&#8221; She spared no consideration for Ayla&#8217;s own journey. It had pre-empted her own. She whirled her sorrel around with a touch on her reins and a tap of the crop. She was disinclined to conversation or any form of communion with her family. The rush of the chase and hunt that awaited was the sole reason that this afternoon suddenly had any value, and she fully intended to run her prey to ground. A nudge of her heels and her horse took off at a loping gallop in the direction of the hounds, where the Master would likely make his appearance any moment.</p>
	
	<p>Lian&#8217;s expression had shadowed, and Delilah suffered that subtle draw to bring her in closer to his side. He knew from the moment Shar&#8217;s chord had beat against his soul, that he could not leave her alone, today.</p>
	
	<p>It had been a risk to bring Delilah as a guest. He had known it would be when he made the offer, even if he could not have known which of his brides would be present for the sport. He breathed in, turning his head toward the area of the yard where two of his queens were mounted. It was Shar who had his attention as she pushed her horse to a gallop away; a quiet and steady stare that for all his composure was at odds with the sharp, discordant thrum of strings that lifted in his blood. It was warning, as much as a father might give a child he expected to be disobedient.</p>
	
	<p>Delilah felt the subtle shift in the energy of the man on her arm. He seemed less relaxed, and wound up with a tension that she could not place a source for. Had it been something she&#8217;d said? A glance up into his face caught the direction of his eyes, and she could see two women parting ways. Was he an acquaintance of either?</p>

	<p>Lian let his attention shift back to the woman on his arm. &#8220;You look beautiful. The color suits you&#8230; and I daresay it will be difficult to lose sight of you on the mounts. We should find our horses before the Colonel wakes to sound his horn.&#8221;</p>
	
	<p>Any stir of curiosity Delilah had for the unknown women was blown away by his compliment and reminder of the purpose for the day. &#8220;I shall hold you to your promise to stay close&#8230;&#8221; she teased with a laugh, suddenly excited for the run ahead. The opportunity to lose herself to the abandon of the wild ride only seemed to mirror the wild abandon that she was feeling inside. She did not think that she had ever been as happy in her life.</p>
